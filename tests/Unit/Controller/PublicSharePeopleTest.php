/**

 * These assertions moved here with the endpoint. They used to construct a
 * PeopleController, because getPeopleByShare() lived there and delegated to
 * getPeople(); now the endpoint sits with the rest of the anonymous surface
 * and runs the query through PeopleQuery, which has no faceted branch at all.
 *
 * The decision under test is unchanged: a facet panel on a share link is a
 * browsable directory of the organisation — roles, buildings, departments and
 * their headcounts — so the endpoint must refuse those parameters itself
 * rather than trusting the frontend not to send them.
