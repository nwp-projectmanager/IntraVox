/**
 * Per-user data must never enter the distributed cache. (CACHE-NS)
 *
 * The distributed cache is shared across every user of the instance, so any
 * field whose value depends on WHO is asking leaks between them for the
 * lifetime of the entry. This actually happened: issue #70 saw an editor's
 * canWrite served to a read-only user for up to an hour, leaving the Edit
 * button visible to someone whose save then 403'd.
 *
 * That bug was fixed in 7f51849 by stripping the per-user fields before
 * storing, and the audit that produced this refactor plan predates the fix.
 * What was missing is anything that keeps it fixed: delete the unset() line and
 * the whole suite still passes. This test pins the property.
 *
 * It reads the source rather than exercising the cache because the alternative
 * is standing up a distributed cache plus two user sessions in a unit test; the
 * property being protected is exactly "this line is still here".
