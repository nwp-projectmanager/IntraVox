# Changelog

All notable changes to IntraVox will be documented in this file.

IntraVox is a Nextcloud intranet page builder.

## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0] - 2026-09-16 — The page engine, taken apart, and hardened

A structural release: the page engine was taken apart, and almost nothing about
using IntraVox changes. The version is 3.0.0 because the internals moved
wholesale, not because the app does anything new.

Alongside the refactor, IntraVox went through a full security review, and this
release includes the resulting hardening across access control, sharing, media
handling, import and the feed and directory integrations. The details below are
kept deliberately general.

Two reported behaviours *do* change, both of them things that were wrong:
Nextcloud admins are no longer forced back into "IntraVox Admins" on every
update (#113), and feed items without a link no longer behave like broken ones
(#114). Everything else should look and work exactly as 2.7.1 did.

### Security

A security review led to a set of hardening changes. None require any action
when upgrading, and none change how content is stored. In summary:

- **Access control is enforced consistently on every endpoint.** Reading,
  editing, locking, analytics, template management, page comments and the news
  feed all check the caller's permissions on the specific page or resource, and
  respect Team folder Advanced Permissions (ACLs) and a page's publication state
  (draft, scheduled or expired). Export and import now require administering the
  Team folder IntraVox lives in, rather than being available to any account.

- **Public shares only expose what the sharer can see.** Every share endpoint —
  the page tree, page and media content, news and navigation — is served through
  the share owner's own ACL-filtered view, so a folder share never republishes
  pages or files an ACL hides from the person who shared it. Share widgets that
  read from a configured connection are limited to the data the share actually
  publishes.

- **Uploaded and imported media are handled safely.** Files served to the
  browser use the correct content type and disposition, SVGs are sanitised, and
  ZIP imports apply the same file-type restrictions and sanitisation as a normal
  upload. Template, media and share identifiers are validated to keep file
  access within IntraVox's own folders.

- **Integrations require IntraVox access and do not leak internals.** The feed
  and people/directory endpoints require IntraVox access, the OAuth callback is
  bound to the session that started it, the outbound image proxy stays restricted
  to signed, external addresses, and error responses no longer expose internal
  details. Server-side identifiers for new pages are always assigned by the
  server.

These were found during our own review before release; there is no indication of
any of them having been exploited.

### Changed

- **Export and import are now for Team folder administrators, not only
  Nextcloud admins.** Both used to require membership of the server's `admin`
  group. That was the wrong question: they act on the whole folder, so what
  matters is who administers *that folder* — which Nextcloud already answers
  through the Team folder's "Manage advanced permissions". A delegated manager
  can now export and import without being a server administrator, continuing
  where the "IntraVox Admins" change below leaves off
  ([#113](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/113)): managing knowledge
  and administering a server stay different jobs.

  Nextcloud admins keep access, so nothing is taken away from an existing
  installation. Note that this is an API-level change: the export and import
  screens still live in the Nextcloud admin settings, so a delegated manager
  reaches them through the API rather than that page for now.

### Fixed

- **Pages loaded again after the split.** `FolderContext` resolved the user's
  home directory instead of the mounted IntraVox Team folder, because the
  dependency container filled a seam meant only for tests. The app rendered
  with no pages at all — HTTP 200, nothing in the log. It now refuses to be
  built that way.

- **`occ` commands work again.** The same class captured the user id when the
  container built it, but `occ` sets the user during `execute()`, long after.
  Every command that touches pages — `intravox:reindex`, `intravox:import`,
  `intravox:repair-entities` — failed with "User not logged in". The user is
  now resolved when asked for, not when constructed.

- **Nextcloud admins are no longer permanently IntraVox admins.**
  ([#113](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/113)) Setup seeded every
  member of the `admin` group into "IntraVox Admins" and granted `admin` full
  rights on the Team folder. Both were re-applied on *every app update*, because
  setup runs as a repair step — so removing someone worked until the next update
  put them back. The intent was sound: an installation whose owner leaves should
  not become unmanageable. Enforcing it forever was not, because managing
  knowledge and administering a server are different jobs, held by different
  people.

  Provisioning now happens once. Existing installations keep exactly the access
  they have — the first run after upgrading still seeds — and only the
  overwriting stops. After that, removing someone from "IntraVox Admins", or
  setting the `admin` group to read-only on the Team folder, sticks. Both are
  done in the Team folders interface; IntraVox simply stops overruling it.

  This is not a security boundary, and is not meant as one: a Nextcloud admin
  can always add themselves back. What changes is that they no longer get it by
  default.

- **Feed items without a link no longer navigate back to the page they sit on.**
  ([#114](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/114)) An item whose
  connection returned no URL rendered as `<a href="">`, and an empty `href`
  resolves to the current document — so clicking it reloaded the IntraVox page,
  looking like a broken link rather than an absent one. Such items are now plain
  text. This affects any custom connection whose URL mapping comes back empty.

- **Team folder ACLs are still honoured after the split.**
  ([#112](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/112)) The 2.7.1 fix
  scoped page-tree and News cache entries per user when Advanced Permissions
  are on. That fix lived in `PageService`, which this release deletes, so it
  was re-applied by hand to the services that inherited the caches. An
  integration test now asserts both call sites, because a hand-carried security
  fix is exactly the kind that gets dropped.

### Added

- **An integration suite that actually runs.** 33 tests against a real
  Nextcloud with real Team folders, exercising the folder resolution and ACL
  paths that unit tests cannot reach — they stub the filesystem away. It runs
  in CI against Nextcloud 32, 33, 34 and 35.

  The three bugs above were all invisible to 1321 passing unit tests. Two of
  them shipped an empty app.

### Compatibility

Nextcloud 32–35, PHP 8.2 or newer. Note that Nextcloud 35 itself requires PHP
8.3, so that combination needs 8.3 regardless of what this app asks for.

Upgrading is a normal app update: no migration, no configuration change, and
no change to how content is stored on disk.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-09-07 — Team folder ACLs are honoured where they were not

### Fixed

- **Navigation and footer no longer served past an explicit ACL deny.**
  ([#112](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/112)) IntraVox reads
  `navigation.json` and `footer.json` through the user's own view and falls back
  to a system-context read when that fails — a department-only member has no
  read right on the language root and must still get a menu. An explicit deny on
  the *file* arrived as the same failure, so the fallback served exactly what the
  administrator had forbidden, page titles included. The fallback is now limited
  to the case it exists for: if a user can reach the language folder, a file they
  cannot see there is a deliberate deny and stays denied. The check fails open, so
  an unexpected error can never blank out everyone's menu.

- **The Edit button no longer appears for a navigation or footer nobody may
  save.** ([#112](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/112)) The check
  asked whether the language *folder* was writable, while saving writes
  `navigation.json`; an ACL denying just that file left an Edit affordance whose
  save then failed with a permission error. It now gates on the file — the same
  correction pages received in
  [#70](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/70).

- **Pages no longer stay invisible for users who are allowed to read them.**
  ([#112](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/112)) The page tree is
  cached per group set, which assumes group members see the same content. With
  Advanced Permissions that does not hold: rights differ per user *within* a
  group, so whoever loaded a page first decided what the rest of their group saw
  for the next five minutes. Cache entries are now scoped to the user whenever
  ACLs are enabled; installations without ACLs keep the shared, cheaper key and
  see no change. The News widget draws from the same pages and got the same
  treatment.


## [2.7.0] - 2026-09-05 — Filters that can exclude, and a News filter that stopped returning 500

### Changed

- **Nextcloud 35 support declared** — `info.xml` now ships
  `<nextcloud min-version="32" max-version="35"/>`. Verified on a running
  Nextcloud 35 (beta 4 through RC3): the app installs, indexes and renders, and
  survives the upgrades between candidates with its data intact. The RC3 round
  ran with MetaVox alongside it, so the MetaVox-backed filters are covered too —
  that needs MetaVox 2.2.2 or later, the first release allowing Nextcloud 35.

### Added

- **Filters can now exclude instead of only include.** Text fields already had
  "does not contain", but the group field and other choice fields offered no
  negation at all — so "everyone in Domain Users except Board Members and
  Service accounts" could not be expressed without creating a dedicated
  directory group to feed the widget. Two operators are added: **does not
  equal** and **is none of**. On a field holding several values, such as group
  membership, they mean "in none of these".
  ([#108](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/108))

### Fixed

- **A News widget filtering on a MetaVox multiselect field returned a 500.**
  MetaVox stores a multiselect as one `;#`-joined string and IntraVox never
  split it. Two more operators failed silently on the same cause: "is one of"
  and "contains all" matched nothing, so a correctly configured widget showed
  "no news" while matching pages existed.
  ([#111](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/111))

- **"Does not contain" quietly matched everything** instead of excluding: the
  chosen values never reached the matcher for that one operator.

- **Picking several filter values needed ctrl/cmd-click, with nothing saying
  so.** The MetaVox filter row used plain `<select>` elements, so every click
  replaced the previous choice. The three controls now use `NcSelect` like the
  rest of the app: chips with their own remove button, a search box once the
  list grows, and the list stays open while picking.
  ([#111](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/111))

- **Text was unreadable on a widget with a coloured background.** The three
  status colours are pale pastels in the Nextcloud theme but were treated as
  dark, forcing white text onto near-white. On a People widget set to one of
  those, names, roles and email addresses were effectively invisible.

- **The filter panel's hover and count badges sat below the contrast minimum.**
  Their translucent white overlays lightened the background towards the white
  text; they now darken instead. "Clear all" no longer renders in a near-
  invisible brown on a coloured widget.

- **Translator hints written in Vue templates never reached the translators.**
  The POT generator only read `// TRANSLATORS:` line comments, so the
  HTML-comment form used inside a `<template>` was dropped.

## [2.6.3] - 2026-09-02 — A patched editor library

### Security

- **The rich-text editor is updated against a prototype-pollution flaw.** In the
  editor library IntraVox uses, `mergeAttributes()` turned an own `__proto__`
  key into inherited, executable DOM attributes — a route to running script
  through crafted content. The library is updated to a patched version, where
  such a key stays an inert value and no attribute is inherited from it.
  Nothing changes in how the editor behaves.

### Changed

- **Build dependencies updated.** Several packages used only while building
  IntraVox were updated to patched versions. They are not part of the shipped
  app and change nothing at runtime.

## [2.6.2] - 2026-09-02 — A display option that promised directory fields it could never show

### Fixed

- **The "Custom fields (LDAP/OIDC)" display option did nothing on almost every
  instance.** Enabling it changed nothing on the cards, with no empty section
  and no warning — so an administrator with a perfectly healthy LDAP connection
  was left looking for a fault in their directory configuration. The option is
  now only offered when the instance actually has custom fields to show, and
  IntraVox detects those fields instead of assuming they exist. Nothing changes
  for an instance that does populate them: the option appears as before, and a
  widget that already had it switched on keeps working.
  ([#106](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/106))
- **Visitor filters showed raw field names instead of their labels.** A filter
  panel listed its groups as `displayName` and `pronouns`, and a label set in
  the widget settings was ignored entirely. Two things went wrong: the settings
  store a field the way it was written while the results come back in the
  server's spelling, so the two never matched; and a group that was never
  renamed had no name to fall back on. Groups now carry their proper heading —
  translated — and a custom label reaches the panel again.
- **The filter panel was hard to read on a coloured widget.** It used the theme
  text colours, which assume the page background, so on a widget with its own
  background the headings, counts and search boxes ran from faint to
  practically invisible. The panel now takes its colours from the background it
  sits on, keeping text legible at any theme colour.

### Changed

- **The People widget documentation no longer promises fields Nextcloud cannot
  store.** It listed Employee ID, Cost Center, Office Location, Employee Type
  and Manager as automatically detected from LDAP or OIDC. Nextcloud keeps a
  fixed allowlist of sixteen account properties and discards anything outside
  it, so a directory attribute such as `employeeNumber` has nowhere to be saved
  and no app can read it back. The English and Dutch pages now explain that
  limit and document what does work: mapping a directory attribute onto an
  existing profile field — Organisation, Role, Address, Headline, Phone or
  Biography — under Special Attributes in the LDAP settings. Fields mapped that
  way appear in the widget on their own, each with its own display option and
  filter.
- **The visitor filter settings explain themselves better.** The box beside each
  filterable field is for renaming the group visitors see, but sat unlabelled
  next to a value filter and read as somewhere to type a value. The list now has
  column headings, and the box shows the name it would use by default. A green
  notice announcing that filter counts would be exact has been dropped: it only
  ever appeared when nothing was wrong.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-08-31 — One honest subscription notice, and a page tree that scrolls on a phone

### Changed

- **The subscription notice says something true.** The settings banner claimed
  "Page limit reached for one or more languages. Upgrade for unlimited pages",
  but that limit is not enforced anywhere — it announced a restriction that does
  not exist. IntraVox has no feature gating and never will: it behaves
  identically with and without a subscription. The notice now appears above 100
  users, the point where paid subscriptions begin in the price list, and says
  plainly that everything keeps working either way. An instance with a Nextcloud
  Enterprise subscription sees a notice pointing at its own account manager
  instead, since IntraVox subscriptions are sold and invoiced through Nextcloud.
  At most one notice ever shows, and the banner and the Support tab now draw
  their text from one place so they cannot drift apart.
- **The close button on that banner is gone.** It set a flag that was forgotten
  on reload, so the banner came back anyway — an offer to dismiss that did not
  dismiss.

### Fixed

- **A navigation item without a link disappeared after a refresh.** Adding a menu
  item and saving it before setting its page or URL appeared to work, but the
  item was gone on the next load — from the menu and from the edit dialogue, so
  the link could never be added afterwards. Nothing was lost: the item stayed in
  navigation.json, it was only unreachable. The menu still hides such an item —
  a heading that leads nowhere and holds nothing has no place there — but the
  editor now keeps showing it, so building a structure first and linking pages
  later works as expected.
  ([#104](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/104))
- **The mobile menu was too narrow and the page showed beside it.** The dropdown
  sized itself to its contents, which on a phone left it covering about 40% of
  the screen with the page visible next to it and names wrapping in a narrow
  column. It now uses the screen width, keeping a margin so it still reads as a
  panel over the page.
- **Sub-items in the mobile menu were not indented and long names ran on.** The
  level styling targeted a class Nextcloud only applies to some labels, so for
  most items the indent, smaller type and muted colour silently did nothing —
  and a long name was cut off by the menu edge. Sub-levels now indent again, and
  a name too long for one line wraps with every line kept at its level.
- **The page structure panel could not be scrolled on an iPhone.** A swipe at the
  end of the list dragged the page behind the panel instead of scrolling the
  list itself, and on iOS the panel was sized against a viewport taller than the
  visible screen, so its lower entries sat behind Safari's toolbar. The panel now
  measures against the visible screen and keeps a swipe inside the list.
  ([#103](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/103))

## [2.6.0] - 2026-08-29 — Exports that import again, and the API split into seven controllers

### Security

- **The protection against internal addresses now covers the calendar and import
  paths too.** 2.5.0 fixed this for the feed reader; two further places did the
  same check and were missed. The one used for external calendar (ICS) feeds is
  the one that matters, because it can be reached without signing in. All three
  now share a single implementation that refuses anything it cannot positively
  confirm as external. **Upgrading promptly is worthwhile if you allow public
  share links.** As in 2.5.0, this may reject a source on an unusual internal
  DNS setup — configure those through a reachable public hostname.
- **SVG images fetched by the feed reader are sanitised by the same code as
  uploads.** The feed reader carried a second, weaker copy of that logic. Both
  paths now go through one implementation, so a hardening change can only be
  made in one place and cannot be missed in the other.

The entries above say what was affected and who was exposed — enough to judge how
urgently to upgrade — without the detail needed to reproduce them. If you operate
IntraVox and need specifics for your own assessment, contact us rather than
working from this file.

### Fixed

- **Exporting a language produced an unusable file when MetaVox is installed.**
  The exported archive could not be read back in, so it was no good as a backup
  or for moving content between instances. Every export from such an instance
  was affected; exports from instances without MetaVox were fine. Re-export to
  get a working file — nothing else needs doing, and previously exported
  archives can be discarded.
- **The page structure panel could not be scrolled on a phone.** The list ran off
  the bottom of the screen with no way to reach the rest of it, so anything below
  the fold was unreachable. The panel now keeps its title, tabs and close button
  in place while the list itself scrolls.
- **The panel title and close button sat behind the Nextcloud header on a phone.**
  Part of the heading was cut off and the close button was mostly covered, which
  made the panel hard to dismiss. Both are clear of the header now.

### Changed

- **The API is now served by seven focused controllers instead of one.** Every
  URL, parameter and response is unchanged — the route table and the OpenAPI
  description are checked against the code on every build, and both are
  identical to 2.5.0. Nothing to do when upgrading; this is groundwork that
  makes the next round of changes safer to review.
- **A static analyser (PHPStan) now runs in CI.** It caught a handful of latent
  problems while this release was being prepared, all fixed here.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-26 — The API describes itself, and the description is checked

### Security

This release fixes several issues found during a security review of the API. The
entries below say what was affected and who was exposed — enough to judge how
urgently to upgrade — without the detail needed to reproduce them.

- **Footer content is now sanitised on the server.** It previously relied on the
  editor to do that, which a direct API call does not go through. Anyone able to
  edit the footer could leave active content behind that ran for other signed-in
  visitors of that language. Public share links were not affected. Nothing to do
  after upgrading; if you want certainty, open and re-save the footer per
  language.
- **Error responses no longer disclose internal server detail.** Several failure
  paths returned the underlying error text, which could include server paths and
  the state of stored credentials. They now return a generic message plus an
  error id that points to the full detail in the server log.
- **The People widget on a public share now answers only from what that page
  publishes.** It previously accepted a caller-supplied selection and answered
  from the whole directory. **This affected only instances with
  `public_share_allow_people` set to `yes`**, which is off by default. If you
  have it enabled, upgrading promptly is worthwhile.
- **The feed reader's protection against internal addresses now fails closed.**
  Some hosts skipped the check. It now refuses anything it cannot positively
  confirm as external, which may reject a source on an unusual internal DNS
  setup — configure those through a reachable public hostname.

If you operate IntraVox and need specifics for your own assessment, contact us
rather than working from this file.

### Fixed

- **Importing a Confluence space did not work at all.** The import endpoint failed on every call because of a wiring error, so nothing could be imported through it. It works now, and a test covers the case that was missed.
- **Orphaned content could not be recovered into a language beyond nl, en, de or fr.** Two different language lists were being checked, and the narrower one — hardcoded, four entries — ran first. A site running any other content language could create pages in it, serve them and export them, but not recover them out of an orphaned group folder. Both checks now use the same list, which follows what the site has actually enabled.
- **Listing pages had no upper bound.** `GET /api/pages` returned every page in a language with no limit, so the largest customer decided the response size. It is now capped, and says so in a response header when a result was truncated. The body shape is unchanged.

### Changed

- **The OpenAPI specification now describes the whole API and is checked against the running server.** It covered 79 of 175 routes and several of those descriptions were wrong — a shared schema for reactions described fields no response has ever carried, poisoning six operations at once. All 171 in-scope routes are now documented; four browser routes that return HTML are listed as deliberately out of scope with a reason. A build gate keeps it that way: a new route without documentation fails the build, and the specification's version is now kept in step with the app's.
- **`openapi.json` ships with the app.** It always did, while the release checklist claimed the opposite — which meant a wrong specification was published to every installation rather than kept in the repository. The file is on disk in the app directory; it is not served over HTTP.

### Notes for API clients

- **Comment and reaction errors changed shape.** A failing call now returns `{"success": false, "error": "…", "errorId": "…"}` instead of a bare message. No part of the IntraVox interface read that body, so nothing in the app changes; a script that parsed the old error text will now see a generic sentence and should log `errorId` instead.
- **Repeated failed authentication returns 429 on any endpoint.** This is Nextcloud's brute-force protection rather than an IntraVox limit, and it applies whether or not an endpoint declares one of its own. Once triggered it keeps returning 429 even for correct credentials until the window passes — so a client retrying a bad token locks itself out instead of getting through. Treat 401 as final.

### Follow-up work

Planned for later releases, listed so the scope of this one is clear.

- **Migration provenance is partly built.** A page can carry the identifier and
  URL of the system it came from, and those survive editing. The lookup that
  finds a page by its source identifier still needs a schema change, deliberately
  coordinated with the multi-site work so it happens once rather than twice. The
  API makes no promises about provenance yet.
- **Delta imports and link rewriting are not built.** Both depend on that lookup.
  An import today is a full import; re-running one is governed by the overwrite
  option, which the admin guide describes.
- **Bulk operations report per item, not per site.** A partial batch tells you
  which pages failed and why, without a per-site summary.
- **Nextcloud 35 is not yet declared supported.** This release stays on 32–34.
  The compatibility update is a separate, smaller release, so the fixes above did
  not have to wait for it.
- **Error handling is being tightened across the remaining endpoints,**
  continuing the work described under Security.

### Notes for administrators

- **`openapi.json` ships with the app** and always did, though the release
  checklist said otherwise. It sits in the app directory and is not served over
  HTTP. Its version is now kept in step with the app automatically.
- **The contract test needs a running instance and makes many requests.**
  Nextcloud counts those against the network address rather than the user, so
  running it while someone is working in that instance can lock them out
  temporarily. The script clears the counter afterwards, including when
  interrupted.

> **2.4.0 and 2.4.1 were never published.** Both were built and ran on the
> development instance, but the release stopped short of a tag and an App Store
> upload. Their fixes are in `main` and shipped with 2.5.0, so an installation
> upgrading from 2.3.2 gets them. The tags `v2.4.0` and `v2.4.1` were added
> afterwards, on 2026-08-26, so the version history is continuous and
> `git describe` resolves correctly — they mark code, not published releases.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-08-25 — A refused subscription key says why

### Fixed

- **A refused subscription key now says *why* it was refused.** The licence server distinguishes four cases — expired, unknown key, already registered to another instance, and deactivated — and each needs a different response from the administrator. All four surfaced as "Subscription key is invalid or expired", so an administrator whose key was refused because the instance identifier moved would read that as a renewal problem and renew a subscription that was never the issue. The support settings now name the actual reason, including the date an expired subscription lapsed.
- **The admin settings page no longer waits on the licence server.** Opening the settings triggered a live validation call with a ten-second timeout, so a slow or unreachable licence server stalled the page. The status shown now comes from the last check, which the daily background job refreshes; saving a key still validates immediately.
- **Telemetry mis-detected Nextcloud Enterprise.** The subscription check read the *Extended Support* add-on rather than the subscription itself, so instances with a plain Enterprise subscription were reported as Community. It now uses `IRegistry::delegateHasValidSubscription()` (public API since NC 17). This only affects the usage figures reported back to VoxCloud; nothing in the app behaves differently.
- **The instance identifier could change between the cron job and a web request.** Without `overwrite.cli.url` it was derived from the current request host, so the licence server could see one server as two and stop updating its user count. It is now derived from a request-independent source. Instances affected by this migrate themselves at the next report; nothing needs to be reconfigured.
- **Licence reports did not say how the user count was taken,** so the licence server treated them as unverified. The count itself was already correct. The report now includes the counting method and the number of disabled accounts.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-08-24 — Licence reporting counts users like every other app

### Fixed

- **User counts reported to the licence server were far too low.** IntraVox counted the members of a group named exactly `intravox`, and where no such group existed it fell back to counting only users who had logged in at least once. On a server with 107 accounts that reported 5. Neither figure was what a subscription is priced on, and neither matched what the other VoxCloud apps report. It now counts every account on the instance, the same way MetaVox, FormVox, RoomVox and IntroVox do. The group is no longer consulted: customers rename it, split it or never create one, so it was never a dependable basis. Nothing needs to be reconfigured — instances correct themselves at the next report.

### Added

- **Disabled accounts and recent activity are reported alongside the total.** Disabling a user is how Nextcloud offboards someone while keeping their file ownership, so those accounts still exist; reporting them separately makes it visible when a customer has actually shrunk. The number of users who logged in during the last 30 days is reported too, which shows whether the seats a customer pays for are in use.

## [2.3.2] - 2026-08-23 — Comments survive the trashbin

### Fixed

- **Restoring a page from the trashbin brings its comments back.** Deleting a page moved its folder to the trashbin, which is reversible, but wiped its comments and reactions from the database in the same step, which is not. Restoring the page therefore returned it without its discussion, and there was nothing left to recover — no warning beforehand, no way back afterwards. Comment cleanup now runs when the file leaves the filecache for good (the trashbin being emptied) instead of when it is moved there, so comments have the same lifetime as the page they belong to: they survive the trashbin, come back on restore, and are removed for good once the trashbin is emptied. Restoring needs no repair step — the comments were never deleted to begin with.

  Comments belonging to pages deleted **before** this version were already permanently removed and cannot be recovered.

- **After upgrading, run `occ intravox:reindex` once.** The cleanup matches a page by the id of its folder, which is recorded from this version on. Existing rows do not have it yet, so until the reindex has run the comments of a permanently deleted page are kept instead of removed — the safe direction, but they linger. New and edited pages record it by themselves.

- **A page restored from the trashbin reappears in the page structure.** The page came back in Files but stayed missing from IntraVox, because its index row was dropped the moment the page was trashed — and restoring a page fires no event of any kind, so nothing could ever put the row back. The only way out was to run `occ intravox:reindex` by hand, which nothing told you about. Index rows now stay in place while a page sits in the trashbin, and listings ask the filecache whether the page is still live: a trashed page drops out of every listing, and a restored one is back immediately with no repair step. Rows are removed for good, together with the comments, once the trashbin is emptied.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-08-21 — Filenames with accents, umlauts and spaces

### Fixed

- **Images whose filename contains an umlaut, an accent or a space now display.** ([#101](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/101)) Media in the Shared library was served only if its name matched `a-z A-Z 0-9 _ - .`, so `Übersicht.png` and `Team foto.jpg` were refused with an HTTP 400. Because the picker thumbnail, the image widget and the News tile all fetch through that one endpoint, an affected image was blank in all three at once. The check contradicted the rest of the app, which stores those names deliberately — the app was saving an image reference it then refused to serve. Path traversal, dotfiles, executable extensions and control characters are all still refused; they each have their own check and never depended on the character list.

- **An uploaded file keeps the name you gave it.** Accented letters were treated as punctuation and stripped, so `Übersicht.png` was stored as `bersicht.png`, `Öl.png` as `l.png`, and a name written in a non-latin script lost every character and was replaced by `file_<random>`. Letters and digits in any script are now kept. Path separators, control characters and shell metacharacters are still replaced, so the name remains safe to put on disk.

- **"A file with this name already exists" now asks about the right name.** The check used the name as you picked it, while the upload saved the sanitized one. Two files whose names differed only in characters that get replaced were both reported as new, and then collided on save.

- **A filename containing `#`, `%`, `?` or `+` resolves.** Media URLs were assembled by pasting the filename straight into the address, so `foto #1.png` asked the server for `foto ` and rendered blank, and `foto+1.png` arrived as `foto 1.png`. Every part of the path is now encoded, in the widget, the editor preview and the picker alike.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-08-21 - Security hardening: shares, rate limits and uploads

A hardening pass over the parts of the app that face anonymous visitors, plus
the packaging fix below. Several protections that were meant to be active turned
out not to be, and the public share endpoints granted more than they should.

Details of the individual weaknesses are deliberately kept short here. They are
recorded in full in the commit history and in the internal security notes; if
you administer an IntraVox instance and want the specifics before upgrading,
ask us.

**Upgrade note — this changes behaviour on existing sites.** Some requests that
used to succeed now return 404, 401 or 429. That is intentional, and it only
affects access that should not have been possible, but read the first two
entries if you have built anything on the old behaviour.

**Please upgrade.** Everything in this section is fixed in this release and
present in every earlier one.

### Security

- **A share link only opens IntraVox content if it points into IntraVox.**
  Access through the public endpoints was not tied tightly enough to the
  IntraVox Team Folder. Shares of IntraVox pages are unaffected and keep working
  exactly as before.

  *What to check before upgrading:* if you publish IntraVox content through a
  share of a file **outside** the IntraVox Team Folder, that link will stop
  working. Share the page itself instead.

- **A password on a share is now enforced on every endpoint.** Some parts of a
  password-protected share could be reached without entering the password. They
  all require it now. Shares without a password are unaffected.

- **Rate limiting is active again.** The limits were configured but not being
  applied. The public share endpoints now enforce 60 requests per minute per
  visitor, as they were always meant to. Normal reading stays far below that;
  automated hammering will start seeing 429.

- **The brute-force delay on the public share endpoint applies again.** Repeated
  attempts with invalid share tokens are slowed down.

- **Menu links can no longer carry a script URL.** Navigation links were not
  checked strictly enough against the list of permitted URL schemes, which made
  stored cross-site scripting possible for someone who could edit the menu.
  Existing menus are cleaned automatically when read, so no repair step is
  needed.

- **A public share no longer exposes anything beyond what its page publishes.**
  Calendar, feed and RSS widgets on a shared page could be steered to sources
  the page does not use, and those were then read with the share owner's
  permissions. A share is now limited to exactly what the page it belongs to has
  configured.

- **A share scoped to one section stays scoped to that section**, including when
  the shared page has since been moved or deleted.

- **Unpublished pages stay private.** Draft, scheduled and expired pages — and
  the images on them — could still be reached through a share or turn up in
  search results. They now follow the same rule everywhere: hidden from readers,
  still visible to editors.

- **Feed connection settings no longer expose credentials to every user.** The
  connection list stays readable by any logged-in user, because the widget
  editor needs the connection names, but the credential-adjacent fields are now
  administrator-only.

- **Uploaded images are stored under an extension that matches their content**,
  instead of the extension supplied by the browser.

- **Imported pages are sanitised like edited ones.** Import was the one way to
  write page content that skipped the usual checks, including the demo-data
  import, which fetches content over the network.

- **ZIP imports have a size limit**, so a small crafted archive can no longer
  expand far enough to fill the disk. Both import paths now use one extractor
  with a per-file and a total ceiling.

- **A People widget filtered by group can no longer scan the whole directory.**
  The group filter had no upper bound, so one request could build a profile for
  every account on the instance.

- **The instance-wide "allow public link sharing" setting now applies to every
  share endpoint.** Turning link sharing off in Nextcloud's sharing settings
  disables IntraVox's public endpoints along with it. Instances that leave link
  sharing enabled — the default — see no change.

  A malformed share token is also refused before anything is looked up, on all
  endpoints rather than most of them.

- **Widget settings you never chose are stored as their default again.** For a
  handful of settings — how a news, people, feed or story widget is sorted and
  laid out — leaving the choice untouched stored an empty value instead of the
  default. Widgets fell back to sensible behaviour when displaying, so this was
  mostly invisible, but the stored page said something different from what the
  editor showed. Existing pages are corrected the next time they are saved.

### Changed

- **Team Folder lookup happens once per request instead of five times.** Four
  places each walked every Team Folder on the instance to find the IntraVox one,
  and the folder lookup runs on the page-render path. On a server with many Team
  Folders that walk dominated page load; it is now resolved once and reused. If
  two Team Folders share a name the app still picks one, but now says so in the
  log instead of choosing silently.

- **Every endpoint's access rule is now written the modern way, and listed in
  one place.** The app used a mix of old doc-comment markers and current PHP
  attributes; everything is now attributes. `docs/route-table.md` lists all 175
  endpoints with what each one requires — 122 need a logged-in user, 36 are
  admin-only, 17 are public. The file is checked automatically, so a change in
  who may reach an endpoint shows up as a visible diff instead of being buried
  in a controller.

  No endpoint changed what it requires: all 189 handlers were compared before
  and after, and verified on a running server.

- **SVG upload works on App Store installations again.** The release packages
  were built without their PHP dependencies, so the SVG sanitiser was missing
  and uploading an SVG failed with a server error. The dependencies now ship
  with the release, the packaging is checked automatically before publishing,
  and an unavailable sanitiser now refuses the upload rather than crashing —
  an SVG that cannot be checked is never stored.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-18 — A page structure panel that stays open, and a table of contents

The page structure moved out of its pop-up and became a panel beside the content, the way a space sidebar works in Confluence. It stays open while you navigate, and it now has a second view: the headings of the page you are reading.

### Added

- **The page structure is now a panel instead of a pop-up.** It opens from a button next to the breadcrumb — on the same level as the Details button (ℹ️), mirrored: structure on the left, details on the right. The button left the navigation bar, which is now just menu items.

  The panel stays open while you click through pages: it is a table of contents, not a dialog you dismiss. Whether it is open, and which of its two views you last used, is remembered across navigation and page reloads. On screens narrower than 1024px it becomes an overlay instead of pushing the content aside.

- **"On this page": a table of contents of the headings on the current page.** The second tab in the panel lists the headings of the page you are reading, indented by level, and scrolls to a section when you click one. The heading you are currently reading is marked, and that marker follows along as you scroll.

  The headings are read from the rendered page rather than from the stored layout, which is what makes it complete: IntraVox has two kinds of headings — stand-alone heading widgets and headings written inside a text block — and only the rendered page has both, in reading order. It also means a version preview shows that version's headings, and headings inside a collapsed section stay out of the list until you open it.

- **Both views are available in shared (anonymous) pages too.** The public view had the old pop-up; it now has the same panel with the same two tabs. The Details sidebar deliberately stays out: metadata and version history are not public, and there are no share endpoints for them.

### Changed

- **The Details sidebar stays where you put it.** It used to close itself whenever you opened another page, and its button could only open it — closing was possible only from inside the panel. It is now a real toggle that remembers its state, and it keeps its position on screen while you scroll instead of sliding out of view.

- **Less vertical space between rows.** Every row carried two layers of padding, a leftover from the collapsible-rows feature: the row itself and the content wrapper inside it, together 32px above and below every row boundary. Rows with a background colour keep their inner margin — they are visible blocks — while plain rows now flow like a document. Headings gained asymmetric margins (more above than below), so a heading sits with the text it introduces.

- **The mega menu uses the width it needs, up to four columns.** It was locked to two columns regardless of screen width, which made a menu with many sections grow downwards until entries fell off the bottom of the screen. The panel width now follows the number of sections, and is kept inside the viewport so a menu on the right no longer opens off-screen.

- **The page structure and the table of contents share one visual language:** the same row height, the same active marker, the same indentation step. Nextcloud styles every button as bold, which made both lists shout; regular weight is back, with bold reserved for the current item.

### Fixed

- **A heading starting with a number no longer loses it.** "1. Accessing Admin Settings" rendered as ". Accessing Admin Settings": heading widgets were parsed as a markdown *document*, where `1. ` opens a numbered list, so the number was absorbed into list markup. Headings are now parsed as a single line — bold, italics and links still work.

- **Deep links to a section keep working when shared.** A section anchor replaced the page identifier in the address, so `#h-some-section` was all that remained: anyone opening that link landed on the homepage. Section links now name both (`#<pageId>#h-<slug>`). Links already shared in the old format still work on the page that is open.

- **Clicking a heading no longer scrolls it under the navigation bar.** The scroll offset assumed a fixed 80px header, while the actual top bar — title bar plus navigation — is taller, and taller still while editing. It now uses the measured height, so the heading lands clear of the bar in both views.

- **The Details sidebar refreshes when you navigate.** Now that it stays open, it has to follow the page you are on: it went blank on the Details tab and kept the previous page's list on Versions. Along the way, tab changes were not being recorded at all — a Vue 2 idiom (`:active.sync`) that silently does nothing in Vue 3 — so the sidebar believed you were always on the Details tab.

- **The page tree in shared pages is cached.** Building it costs one file read per page, and the public route — unlike the logged-in one — rebuilt it from disk on every request. That went unnoticed while the tree lived in a pop-up you opened occasionally; a panel that loads on every page visit makes it structural. The public tree now uses the same five-minute cache as the rest of the app, and is invalidated by the same page edits. On a 250-page intranet the call went from ~580ms to ~110ms; the cost no longer grows with each visitor.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-08-15 — Page folder names: renaming, and names that stay put

### Added

- **The Rename dialog can now rename the page's folder along with its title** ([#95](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/95), thanks @kma-cloud). Renaming a page used to change only the title: the folder in the Team folder kept its old name, which made rights management confusing — folder names no longer matched what editors saw. The dialog now offers "Also rename the page's folder" with a preview of the old and new name.

  The checkbox is pre-selected while the folder still carries its title-derived name, and off when someone deliberately named the folder something else. The folder and its `.json` are renamed as a pair — or not at all: if the second rename fails, the first is rolled back. Name collisions get a `-2`/`-3` suffix, exactly like creating or moving a page. Sub-pages, images and files travel along; links by page ID, public share links, version history and Team-folder access rules all keep working, because none of them depend on the folder's name.

  One honest limitation, stated in the dialog: very old links that use the folder name in the address (instead of the page ID) stop working after a folder rename. The homepage never offers the option.

### Fixed

- **Translating a page no longer appends `-2` to its folder name.** A translation lands in another language's folder, where the original name is free — but the check that guards against duplicate names looked in the folder of the *editor's own* language instead of the one the page was being written to. Translating `nl/…/niv5` into English therefore found `niv5` in `nl/`, concluded the name was taken, and created `en/…/niv5-2`. Translations now keep the name of the page they were made from.

- **The same name is allowed under different parent pages.** The duplicate check searched the entire language tree, so a page called "Team" under *About* reserved that name intranet-wide: a second "Team" under *Sales* silently became `team-2`. Names now only have to be unique among their direct siblings, which is what the folder structure actually requires — and matches how moving and renaming a page have always behaved. Copying a page into the same folder still gets a `-2` suffix, because there the collision is real.

  Pages that were given a `-2` suffix by the old check keep their current name; rename the page to clean it up.

- **A copied page is no longer treated as a translation of its original.** Copies inherited the link that ties language versions together, which made the copy a second version of the original *in the same language* — the exact state the Translations tab refuses to create, because it leaves the language switcher with two equally valid answers. A copy now starts unlinked.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-14 — Pages know their translations, and large intranets stay fast

This release finishes the multilingual work that 1.9.6 and 1.9.7 started, and rebuilds the foundation it rests on. Upgrading needs no action: the database change is a single optional column, and nothing has to be converted.

### Added

- **A page can now say which languages it exists in.** Until now the Dutch and German version of the same subject were entirely unrelated — nothing linked them, so nothing could offer a reader the other one. Pages can be linked as language versions of each other from the **Translations** tab in the page sidebar.

  Linked pages stay fully separate: each language keeps its own content, layout and publication state, and a page may exist in one language only. Linking says "these are the same subject", nothing more. It is symmetric — there is no "original" and no "copies" — so removing one language shrinks the set instead of breaking the others.

- **Readers are told when a page is not in their language, and offered the version that is.** Opening a link to a page written in another language shows a short notice above the content; when a version in the reader's own language exists, one click switches to it.

  The link always wins: a page you share opens the page you shared, never a redirect to something else. That matters for anyone sending a link in a newsletter or campaign — the recipient sees what the sender saw.

  The content region now also carries the correct language for screen readers, which previously pronounced a foreign-language page with the wrong phonemes.

- **Translating a deeply nested page no longer strands it.** The new page lands in the mirrored spot in the other language, and the page tree shows any not-yet-translated parent levels as non-clickable folder placeholders instead of hiding the page. The create panel says up front how many parent pages are still missing in that language, so editors know what they are getting into before clicking Create.

- **`occ intravox:reindex`** rebuilds the page index from the page files. Use it after a restore or migration, or whenever pages behave as if they are missing while the files are plainly there.

- **MetaVox metadata is back as its own tab in the page sidebar — and now survives Nextcloud upgrades.** The old integration borrowed a Files-app hook (`OCA.Files.Sidebar`) to host MetaVox's panel, and Nextcloud 34 removed that hook, leaving the panel empty. IntraVox now renders the fields itself from MetaVox's own API: the same field types, the same behaviour as in the Files sidebar — including the Save button appearing only once something actually changed — without MetaVox needing a single change. Requires MetaVox ≥ 1.1.1; without MetaVox the tab simply is not there. As a side effect, pages no longer load a MetaVox script and stylesheet they never used.

- **Every sidebar tab now has a direct entry in the page menu.** Details, MetaVox, Translations and Version history sit together in their own menu group, and an entry appears exactly when its tab does: no MetaVox installed → no MetaVox entry, one content language → no Translations entry. The menu can never promise a tab the sidebar does not have.

### Changed

- **Large intranets are dramatically faster.** Finding a page used to read and parse every page file in every language folder. On a 3,000-page, 3-language intranet that was up to 7,500 file reads for a single page view; it is now one indexed lookup. The page list no longer reads every file either.

- **Saving a page that someone else changed in the meantime is now refused instead of silently overwriting it.** Pages are stored whole, so the second of two concurrent saves used to erase everything the first had written. Editors are asked to reload; the existing page lock still prevents the common case.

- **Linking two pages as translations requires edit permission on both pages**, and that is checked before anything is written — a half-made link cannot occur.

### Fixed

- **The intranet could show its first-run "Welcome to IntraVox" screen even though it was full of pages** — for every user except the one whose account happened to write the index entries. Page locations were stored per user, so they never resolved for anyone else.

- **The wrong page could open as the homepage.** Intranets whose homepage is a `home.json` in the language root landed readers on the alphabetically first page instead. Both homepage layouts now resolve correctly, and a homepage configured by an admin still wins.

- **Search missed the fast path for anyone with a regional locale** (`nl_NL`, `de_DE`, …), quietly falling back to a full scan on every query.

- **Search could rank a page template above the real page** ([#96](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/96)). Every tree walker carried its own hand-copied list of folders to skip, and the lists had drifted apart, so walkers that forgot `_templates` served template and resource-library files as real pages. One shared rule now decides what is infrastructure, applied everywhere a walker descends.

- **Deleting a linked translation kept it listed in the open page's Translations tab** until the next full page load — clicking the leftover entry answered "page not found". The list now updates the moment the page is deleted.

- Moving or deleting a page left its sub-pages pointing at folders that no longer existed, and imported pages never entered the index at all.

- **Creating a page in another language now brings the source page's images along.** The text was copied but the images were not — a page's images are stored beside it, so every image on the new translation answered 404. Copying a page already did this correctly; translating now uses the same mechanism.

- **Translation lists respect per-folder access.** The titles of a page's other language versions are filtered against the viewer's own Team Folder access before being shown or cached, so an ACL that hides a folder also hides the titles inside it. Large files in a page copy or translation are now streamed instead of loaded into memory whole.

### Upgrade notes

No action required. The database change is one optional column; existing pages keep working untouched and are simply not linked to any translation until an editor links them. Running `occ intravox:reindex` once after upgrading makes the speed improvements take effect immediately — without it, they arrive gradually as pages are edited.

Sites with a single content language see no translation features anywhere.

## [1.9.8] - 2026-08-09 — Moving, copying and version tools work across languages

*Not published separately — shipped as part of 2.0.0.*

### Fixed

- **Moving a page could silently move it into another language.** Since pages became findable across language folders (1.9.6), a move to the top level sent the page to the root of *your own* language rather than its own — so an editor working in German could drag an English page to the top level and relocate that page, with everything nested under it, into the German intranet. Nothing warned, nothing was logged, and there was no undo. In a bulk move this applied to every selected page at once.

  A move now stays inside the language the page is written in, and a move that would cross that boundary is refused with a message naming both languages instead of being carried out. Language folders are independent content trees — moving a page between them is a relocation between intranets, not a translation.

  Moving a page also checks permissions before it starts. It previously relied on the filesystem to object partway through, which surfaced as an unexplained server error.

- **Copying a top-level page put the copy in the wrong language.** Copying a root-level English page while your own language was German created the copy in the German tree. Copies now stay in the language of the page they were copied from.

- **Templates and copies of a page in another language lost their images.** "Save as template" and copy-page looked for the page's media in your own language folder, found nothing, and carried on silently — producing a template or copy with no images and no warning.

- **Version history tools failed on pages in another language.** "Compare with current" and naming a version reported `Page not found`. Both also failed on any page addressed by its modern unique id, regardless of language.

- **The page cache diagnostic reported healthy pages as missing.** Pages in another language came back as "Page folder not found", which is a misleading signal when troubleshooting.

## [1.9.7] - 2026-08-07 — Photos upload to pages in any language

### Fixed

- **Uploading a photo failed with "Upload failed: page not found", on a page that was open in front of you.** Adding a Photo widget and choosing an image appeared to work, and then saving the page reported that the page did not exist. Images placed in the resource folder through Files showed up in the Shared Library as a filename and a size with no preview, and stayed blank when selected. Saving the page first made no difference. ([#92](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/92))

  This is the same read/write split that [#90](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/90) fixed for pages in 1.9.6, in the one place that fix did not reach: media. A page's images live next to the page, but IntraVox looked for them in a language folder chosen for *you* — your Nextcloud display language when uploading, the language you are shown when listing. Whenever those differed from the language the page itself is written in, every media operation searched the wrong folder: uploads reported the page missing, the Shared Library came back empty so previews had nothing to load, and thumbnails answered 404.

  The permission check on the very same request had already found the page correctly, which is why the failure looked so contradictory — permission granted, then "page not found" for the upload that followed.

  Media now resolves through the page it belongs to, so an upload lands beside its own page whichever language that page is in, and the Shared Library lists the library that page actually uses. Uploading to a page that genuinely does not exist answers a plain 404 and writes a log line, instead of the silent 500 that left this issue with no Nextcloud log entries to go on.

  This affected every media widget — Photo, Photo Story, File Story and Gallery — not only the Photo widget.

## [1.9.6] - 2026-08-07 — Pages save in whatever language they were written

### Added

- **Editors are told when a page is not in their own language.** A badge next to the page title appears when the page you are on belongs to a different language than your own — in both view and edit mode. It names the language of the *page*, not of your interface: a German editor opening an English page sees "English", and knows that editing it saves back into English.

  It shows up only when the two differ, so it never becomes a permanent label you stop reading; on a page in your own language, and on any single-language intranet, there is no badge at all. Like the Draft badge it is only shown to people who can edit the page.

  It is an indicator, not a switcher: to work in another language, navigate to that language's pages.

### Fixed

- **Editing a page failed with "Saving failed: Request failed with status code 400" and "Unable to save the page: Page not found".** The page was on screen, it opened in the editor, and the save then insisted it did not exist. ([#90](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/90))

  Reading a page and saving one looked in different places. Opening a page searched the language you are shown — your own language, and failing that the recommended language or English — and then looked through every other language folder besides. Saving searched only the folder matching your own Nextcloud display language, and gave up there. Any page written in one language and opened by someone using another was therefore readable but impossible to save, along with its version history, its metadata and its delete action.

  Nothing was wrong with the page or with the Team Folder holding it. Editing an existing page now writes back to wherever that page actually lives, so anything you can open, you can also save. Creating a *new* page is unchanged: it still lands in your own language folder. Permissions are unchanged too — a read-only member still gets a clear "not allowed" rather than a save that appears to work.

  A page that genuinely does not exist now answers with a plain 404 instead of the contradictory "400 / not found" pair that made this so puzzling to report.

- **A sub-page created under a parent in another language ended up detached from it.** Adding a sub-page to a German parent while your own Nextcloud language was English filed it under English instead — and built an empty `de/departments/…` mirror of the folder structure on the way, whose parent pages did not exist there. The new page disappeared from the very structure it was created in.

  Page creation now follows the structure you are working in rather than your personal language setting. A sub-page joins its parent's language; a top-level page is created in the language you are currently viewing; and only when there is nothing to derive it from does IntraVox fall back to your own language, as before.

  Together with the save fix above, the rule for editors is now a single sentence: **you write where you are looking.** Which language your Nextcloud interface is in no longer decides which content you can work on, and the admin panel's recommended language remains what it always was — a viewing fallback, never a write target.

- **Links to a page in another language resolved inconsistently.** A link carrying a page's unique id found the page wherever it lived, but an older-style link built from the page name only searched your own language folder — so the same page could open, show a different language's page, or fail, depending on which kind of link you happened to follow. Both kinds now resolve the same way.

## [1.9.5] - 2026-08-05 — The People filter panel keeps its options

### Fixed

- **The filter panel lost all its options a few minutes after the page was loaded.** The groups still appeared with their headings, but every one of them read *No matching options* — and then filled back in by itself some minutes later, without anyone changing a thing.

  The widget's configuration was never the problem. The background job that refreshes People data every ten minutes runs without a logged-in session, and it rebuilt each widget's data as though an anonymous visitor had asked for it. That strips every field marked **Local** — including `role` and `organisation` — and skips IntraVox custom fields entirely, which is where fields like *Werking*, *Thema* and *Gebouw* live. The stripped result was then written over the copy meant for logged-in readers. With no values left to count, every group had nothing left to show.

  This only affected instances that had switched on **Visitor filters**, and only from 1.9.4, where both the filter panel and that background job were introduced. The refresh now rebuilds each set of data for the audience it belongs to. Anonymous visitors are unaffected: they still see only what each field's visibility scope allows, so the fix does not widen what a public share can reach.

  No action is needed on upgrade — the affected data is a cache and is rebuilt automatically.

## [1.9.4] - 2026-08-05 — Visitors can filter People widgets themselves

### Added

- **People widgets can now be filtered by the people reading them.** Until now only the editor could decide who a widget showed; a reader got a fixed list. Switch on **Visitor filters** in the widget editor and the widget grows a filter panel: one group per field you choose, each value with a live count, plus an optional search box and removable chips for what is currently selected.

  The counts are the point. They are calculated over the actual result set, and they narrow as you choose — pick a department and the building list immediately shows only buildings where that department sits, with real numbers. Picking a value never empties its own group, so "Noord **or** Zuid" is expressible; that is what makes it a filter panel rather than a series of dropdowns. Whatever a count promises, clicking it delivers exactly that many people.

  A visitor can only ever narrow what the widget already shows. If you scoped a widget to one department, no filter combination reaches outside it — the restriction is built into how the results are assembled, not bolted on afterwards.

  Selections live in the page URL, so a filtered view can be shared or bookmarked and opens filtered. On a phone the panel folds into a **Filters (3)** button. Filters do not appear on public share links: the values would amount to a browsable directory of your organisation for anyone holding the URL.

- **`occ intravox:people:scope-report`** — prints which profile fields will become invisible under the visibility fix below, and for how many accounts. Run it before upgrading; `--all` scans every account instead of sampling.

### Security

- **People widgets no longer appear on public share links.** A public share is normally created to hand someone a set of documents. If the page also carried a People widget, the act of sharing those documents published a staff directory — names, photos and profile fields — to anyone holding the URL, without the people on that list having agreed to it or the person sharing necessarily realising the widget was there.

  People widgets are now withheld from public share links by default. The rest of the page is shared exactly as before. Administrators who have a genuine reason — an external project page with a named contact, say — can allow it under **Settings → Administration → IntraVox → Publication**, but it is now a decision someone takes rather than a side effect of sharing a folder. The `/api/share/{token}/people` endpoint refuses as well, so the widget cannot be reached by calling the API directly.


- **People widgets now respect each field's visibility setting.** IntraVox never consulted the visibility scope Nextcloud stores per account property, so every field the account manager returned was handed to whoever loaded a People widget — including the extra fields your directory syncs (LDAP/OIDC), and including anonymous visitors following a public share link. A phone number or birthdate a colleague deliberately marked **Private** was published anyway.

  From this release the scope is honoured: **Private** fields reach nobody, **Local** fields reach logged-in users only, **Federated** and **Published** fields also reach public shares. The email address was a second route to the same leak — it was read straight from the user account rather than from the scoped property — and now follows the same rule. IntraVox custom fields (set through user preferences rather than Personal info) carry no scope of their own and are treated as **Local**: visible when logged in, never on a public share.

  **This is a visible change, not only a fix.** Fields your users marked private will disappear from existing People widgets. Nothing needs to be run for the upgrade itself, but if you want to know in advance which fields are affected and for how many accounts, `occ intravox:people:scope-report` will tell you. The field most likely to surprise you is **email**: it defaults to Federated, but plenty of instances set it to Local, which removes it from public-share People widgets. Users change this themselves under **Settings → Personal → Personal info**, with the visibility picker beside each field.

  The cached filter results were also shared between users regardless of what each was allowed to see. The cache key now includes both the audience and the viewer's group membership, and the old entries are abandoned rather than reused — otherwise the fix would not have taken effect until they expired.

### Performance

- **People widgets read account data in one query instead of one per user.** Profile data now comes from a single database read rather than a separate call for every account. Measured cold on a 106-account instance, the widget's scan drops from 35–45 ms to around 14 ms; the account read itself falls from 20.4 ms to 1.4 ms per hundred accounts. The remaining time is Nextcloud's own account enumeration, which an app cannot bypass. Instances with tens of thousands of users benefit proportionally.

- **Concurrent visitors no longer each trigger their own rebuild.** When a widget's cached data expired, every visitor arriving at that moment started a full scan of their own. On an LDAP-backed instance, where reading a large group can take half a minute, fifty simultaneous readers meant fifty simultaneous scans. Now one request refreshes while the others are served the previous data, which is at most a few minutes old.

- **A background job refreshes recently-used People widgets** every ten minutes, so in normal use no visitor waits for a rebuild at all. It only touches data that has actually expired, so an idle instance costs nothing.

### Fixed

- **The People widget on a public share always failed.** `/api/share/{token}/people` called a method that does not exist on the share service, so every request died and returned a server error. Anyone with a People widget on a shared page saw an empty widget. It now resolves the share token correctly.

- **The People widget's pagination setting was discarded on every save.** The "show pagination" option was read when rendering but never stored, so it silently reverted each time the page was saved.

## [1.9.3] - 2026-08-05 — Pages are findable by their MetaVox metadata

### Added

- **Search now finds pages by their MetaVox metadata.** A page tagged `City: Liège` or `Primary driver: HENK` was invisible to IntraVox search unless the term also appeared in its title or content — the metadata lives beside the file, not inside the page. Those pages now show up under **IntraVox pages**, with a subline in MetaVox's own format (`Label: value`, joined with ` • `, matching field first, up to three fields) so the same document reads identically in both providers' results. Fields the user may not view are left out, so a restricted metadata field cannot surface here.

### Changed

- **Search results no longer stop at the title index.** The title index was consulted first and returned immediately on a hit, which silently suppressed pages that matched only on content or metadata whenever some other page happened to match on title. Index hits still render first (they are the fastest path); full-text and metadata matches are now appended after them, with duplicates removed.

- **The minimum search length follows the server setting instead of the app.** IntraVox enforced its own two-character minimum, overriding the admin's `unified-search.min-search-length` (Nextcloud's default is 1). Nextcloud already rejects too-short terms centrally, before a provider is ever called, so the app-side check only served to make short but meaningful terms — `HR`, `IT`, CJK characters — unfindable regardless of how the instance was configured. No bundled Nextcloud app defines its own minimum.

## [1.9.2] - 2026-08-04 — Scheduled publishing, section anchors and working public folder shares

### Added

- **A page's "Publish on" / "Expire on" date now controls visibility everywhere.** Previously the publication-date MetaVox fields only filtered the News widget's list; a page with a future publish date was still reachable directly, via the menu, the page tree and public shares. Now a page that is not yet published (future publish date) or has expired is hidden from readers and anonymous visitors — exactly like a draft — and automatically becomes visible the moment its publish time passes (evaluated live, no cron). Editors still see these pages, with a **Scheduled** / **Expired** badge next to the title.

- **Copy a link to any section of a page.** Every heading — both stand-alone heading widgets and headings inside a text block — now gets a stable anchor. Hover a heading to reveal a small link icon; clicking it copies a deep link (e.g. `…?page=…#h-creating-a-new-form`) to the clipboard. Opening that link loads the page and scrolls straight to the section. Works in both the logged-in view and anonymous public shares. Page navigation (`?page=` / `#page-…`) is unaffected — section anchors use a distinct `#h-…` fragment so the two never collide.

### Changed

- **A publish date takes precedence over the manual Draft flag.** Following the WordPress/Drupal model, a page is in exactly one effective state: *Draft* (no date, held back manually), *Scheduled* (a future publish date) or *Published* (publish date has passed, or published with no date). This removes the confusing case where a page showed a **Draft** badge even though its publish date had already passed. In edit mode the manual toggle is then replaced by a read-only chip showing the effective state, with the explanation *"Publication is controlled by the Publish on date. Clear the date to switch manually."*

- **Draft no longer promises more than it delivers.** The status keeps the name **Draft** (consistent with the rest of the industry and with how it is stored), but the wording now states plainly that it is a *visibility filter, not a permission*: the page is hidden from readers everywhere in IntraVox, while the page file itself keeps the folder's normal Nextcloud rights. Editing a draft page shows this as a standard Nextcloud info note card; the status badges carry a short, state-specific tooltip.

- **The editor documentation is clearer about what "draft" does and does not hide.** It previously claimed a draft was "completely invisible to readers", which was only true inside IntraVox: the draft status hides a page within IntraVox's own views, but the underlying file still lives in the Team folder and can be reached through Nextcloud's own features. The guide (EN + NL) now explains this and advises restricting the folder with Team folder permissions for genuinely confidential content, rather than relying on draft status alone.

- **The details sidebar (ⓘ) is now reachable while editing.** It was hidden in edit mode, so setting a page's *Publish on* date — which lives in the sidebar's MetaVox tab — meant leaving the editor first.

- **The status updates immediately after saving a publish date.** MetaVox stores those dates itself, outside IntraVox's own save flow, so a page you had just scheduled kept showing its old **Draft** badge until you reloaded. IntraVox now picks up the save and re-reads the page's publication state straight away. While editing, an info note explains the current state — including what **Scheduled** means and that the publish date overrides the Draft/Published button.

### Fixed

- **Public link shares on a page folder now render for anonymous visitors.** Opening the anonymous URL of a shared folder (e.g. a whole-language or sub-tree share) returned "This page is not available or the share link has expired" for every page under it — the share tree loaded, but each individual page 404'd. The page-scope check compared a per-user *mount* path (`/Sam/files/IntraVox/en/docs/…`) against the GroupFolder *storage* path (`files/en/docs`), so nothing ever matched. Pages are now resolved by their fileid in the GroupFolder storage — the same robust lookup already used for the share path — so folder-level public sharing works.

- **Internal links inside a shared page now navigate.** In the public (anonymous) share view, clicking an internal page link in a Link or News widget did nothing — the shared view's navigation handler only understood the Navigation bar's object payload and silently ignored the bare page-id string that widgets emit. Both payload shapes are now handled, so sub-page tiles/links inside a folder share work.

- **The breadcrumb inside a public folder share shows the full path.** On a nested page in a shared folder (e.g. Docs → FormVox → User → *Creating Forms*), the anonymous breadcrumb collapsed to just the share root, because the builder was fed a per-user mount path that could not be normalised against the share scope. It now uses the canonical GroupFolder-storage path, so all levels between the share root and the current page appear and are clickable.

- **Draft and scheduled pages no longer leak into a public share's menu or page tree.** The share navigation and tree now apply the same visibility rules as the page content (which already returned "not available").

- **The News widget's "show only published pages" option now really hides drafts.** News items were assembled without their publication status, so the filter saw every item as published and removed nothing. It also gave up when no publication date fields were configured or MetaVox was absent, and the caller only ran it when MetaVox was installed — in each of those cases drafts still showed. The status now travels with each item and is always honoured. A News widget inside a public share had no filter at all and could list drafts to anonymous visitors; it does now.

- **News cards meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast, including on hover.** On a coloured (dark) row, cards are drawn on a light tint but their text used the white "on primary" colour — measured 1.17:1 for titles and 1.12:1 for date and excerpt, where 4.5:1 is the minimum for body text. Titles now use Nextcloud's matching light-surface colour (12.96:1) and the date and excerpt use the full text colour instead of an opacity fade. Hovering previously flipped the card to a dark blue while the text stayed dark (1.75:1); the card now keeps its light tint (11.59:1). The carousel's secondary text (3.80:1) was corrected as well.

- **Publication dates are time-aware and use the instance timezone.** The check compared dates only, so a page scheduled for later *today* counted as already published; and a time entered as local time (e.g. 15:57 in Amsterdam) was compared against a UTC clock, so a page could read "Scheduled" for hours after it was live. Dates now respect the time of day and are read in the instance timezone (the `logtimezone` system setting → the viewer's Nextcloud timezone → the server default); dates with an explicit offset keep their own zone. **Administrators on a UTC server should set `logtimezone`**, otherwise anonymous share visitors — who have no personal timezone — see scheduled pages appear at the wrong local time. See the editor guide for the command.

- **Blank items in the text widget's "Paragraph" dropdown.** The heading options (H1–H4) below "Paragraph" rendered empty because their labels were passed to the translation function with the level as the app id. The markers now show correctly.

- **Several untranslated interface strings are now translatable.** The page tree's "Show N more…" button and its expand/collapse labels, the navigation editor's focus-trap label, and the admin video-recommendation risk badges, category names and People-widget fallback field labels were hard-coded (or passed a variable the extractor never saw), so they stayed English in every language. They now go through the translation system.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-08-03 — Tidier page actions menu, permission follow-ups + dependency security updates

### Changed

- **The page actions (⋯) menu is now grouped.** As the menu grew it had become a flat, interleaved list. Its items are now organised into logical groups — page actions (Rename, Page settings, Copy, Save as template), site (New page, Edit navigation), utility (RSS feed) and the destructive Delete on its own — separated by thin dividers. The dividers adapt to your permissions, so you never see a stray or doubled line: a read-only visitor sees a clean short menu, the homepage hides Delete, and so on. No actions changed — only their order and grouping.

- **The help text in the Page structure and Edit navigation dialogs is collapsible.** The multi-line explanation that filled the top of those dialogs every time is now a single collapsed line ("About the page structure" / "About editing navigation") that expands on click — the guidance is still there, but no longer in the way once you know it.

### Fixed

- **Copy, and the navigation editor, now respect per-user permissions correctly in Team folders** ([#86](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/86) follow-up, thanks @kma-cloud). Three remaining gaps after 1.9.0: (1) the page tree's **Copy** button appeared where the user couldn't actually create, then failed — it now copies a page as a sibling into its own parent and is shown only where the backend will allow it (root-level items are gated on create-permission at the language root). (2) Trying to save the navigation without write permission returned a **500 error** instead of a clean refusal — it now returns 403. (3) **Edit navigation** is gated strictly on write access to the root, so a read-only user no longer sees a button whose save would be refused.

### Security

- **Dependency updates.** Patched bundled front-end dependencies to clear all known npm advisories (axios, postcss, dompurify, fast-uri, linkify-it, brace-expansion) — non-breaking patch/minor bumps, no functional change.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-08-02 — Rename pages, File Story pagination, per-user Team-folder permissions + special-character and widget-filter fixes

### Added

- **Rename a page directly from the UI** ([#84](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/84), thanks @kma-cloud). A page's title could only be changed from the Details sidebar, which nobody found — so it looked like pages couldn't be renamed at all. There is now a **Rename page** entry in the page actions menu (the ⋯ menu on the page you're viewing) and a rename button in the **page tree**'s manage mode, both available to anyone with edit rights. Renaming only changes the page's title — the page's address (folder) and all links to it stay exactly the same, so nothing breaks. When the navigation menu label still matched the old title, it's updated to the new one automatically; a menu label you'd deliberately set to something different is left untouched.

- **Page buttons for the File Story and Photo Story widgets** ([#78](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/78), thanks @kma-cloud). Setting a maximum number of documents used to hide everything past that count, with no way to reach older files. Both widgets now have a **Long lists** choice: keep the existing *Infinite scroll*, or switch to *Page buttons* with a **Documents/Photos per page** size and Previous/Next buttons that page through the rest, so everything stays reachable and the widget keeps a predictable height. **Maximum documents/photos** stays a separate, optional total cap that applies in both modes. Page buttons apply where the widget already paginates — File Story's List and Tiles, Photo Story's single-folder Timeline and Grid; the other layouts always use infinite scroll. Existing widgets are unchanged (they default to infinite scroll).

### Fixed

- **The filter operator dropdown in the People and News widgets was blank.** When filtering people or news by attribute, the operator selector (equals / contains / is not empty / …) rendered empty options — only a checkmark, no text — so you could not tell which condition you were choosing. The template translated the labels with a single-argument `t(op.label)` call, which `@nextcloud/l10n` read as the app id and returned `undefined` (the same bug class as #79). The labels are now translated correctly and, as a bonus, are actual translatable strings (they were previously hardcoded English that no language could translate).

- **Special characters in page titles work correctly.** A title like `Collega's` was stored HTML-encoded (`Collega&apos;s`) and shown with the literal entity in the title, breadcrumb and heading; `A & B`, quotes and `<>` were mangled the same way. Plain-text fields (page and widget titles, alt text, link labels) are no longer HTML-encoded at storage — the frontend and the RSS/export sinks already escape at output, so there is no security regression. An `occ intravox:repair-entities` command (with `--dry-run` and `--user`) decodes titles/text already corrupted by the old behaviour. Two related fixes: accented and non-Latin letters in a title are now transliterated into the folder name (`Müller` → `muller`, `Café` → `cafe`) instead of being dropped (`mller`, `caf`); and creating a page whose title collides with an existing one now opens the newly created page instead of failing to save with "Page not found" (the new page is selected by its stable id, not the derived slug).

- **Page-structure and per-page management now follow per-user permissions in Team folders** ([#86](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/86), thanks @kma-cloud). With GroupFolder Advanced Permissions (ACLs), a user who could write in only one section either saw structure/management controls that then failed with a 403, or did not see them at all. Two causes: (1) the page tree was cached per group, so a per-user ACL grant was not reflected in the tree's permissions — it is now recomputed live for each user (the same per-user approach already used when opening a page); and (2) the "Manage structure" toolbar and the per-page manage actions (reorder, move, rename, copy, set-as-homepage) were shown based on write access to the *root*, not to the actual page. The toolbar now appears whenever the user can manage *any* page, and each action is shown only where the backend will actually allow it, so the UI no longer offers actions that 403. Note: this addresses the UI/permission mismatch only — a per-folder "Read + Write" ACL still requires the user's group to have write at the base level (an ACL cannot grant above a read-only base; see the [authorization docs](https://voxcloud.nl/docs/en/intravox/admin/authorization/)).

- **The "From template" picker went blank as soon as one template existed** ([#79](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/79), thanks @quarterstaff-tech for the thorough diagnosis). With zero templates the picker correctly showed "No templates found", but any template at all made the panel render completely empty — no error, no list. The template preview card tried to look up a per-template translation via `this.t('template_<id>_title')`, calling the `t(app, text)` wrapper with a single argument: the key landed in the `app` slot and the text was `undefined`, so `@nextcloud/l10n`'s `translate()` crashed on `undefined.replace(…)` (`TypeError: can't access property "replace", f is undefined`), taking the whole panel down during render. Those `template_<id>_title` / `template_<id>_description` keys never existed in the translation catalog, so the lookup was dead code that only ever crashed; the card now uses the template's own `title`/`description` directly.

- **Drag-and-drop upload did nothing but open the file in a new browser tab** ([#85](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/85), thanks @kma-cloud). The image/video widget's media picker invited you to "drag and drop", but the drop zone never handled the drag events, so the browser fell back to its default behaviour and navigated to the dropped file instead of uploading it. The drop zone now accepts dropped files into the same upload flow as the file browser, with a highlight while dragging and a type check (native drop ignores the `accept` filter, so an image widget rejects non-image drops, and video rejects non-video). The same missing-handler bug in the admin **Confluence HTML import** drop zone is fixed the same way (validated on the `.zip` extension).

## [1.8.4] - 2026-07-10 — Fix: modals showed "intravox" on every button/label

### Fixed

- **Every button and label in several dialogs read "intravox"** ([#77](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/77)). Four modals used a translation wrapper that put the app id in the wrong argument, so the "Create new page" and "Save as template" dialogs, the page-tree selector, and the "All pages" list rendered the literal string "intravox" for every tab, label, and button — making them unusable. The wrapper is now aligned with the rest of the app (`t(app, text, vars)`), so the real labels show again ("Blank page", "From template", "Page title", "Cancel", "Create", …). Pre-existing bug, unrelated to recent translation changes.

## [1.8.3] - 2026-07-10 — mave.io video support + translation polish

### Added

- **mave.io as an allowed video service** (EU-hosted, cookieless, GDPR-compliant). Because mave.io serves each space from its own subdomain (`space-{hash}.video-dns.com`), a fixed allowlist entry can't match every space, so this adds a wildcard-base-domain mechanism: a whitelisted base domain also matches its subdomains. Matching is boundary-safe (the host must equal the base or end with `.`+base, over HTTPS), so look-alike domains like `evilvideo-dns.com` are rejected. Enforced identically on the backend (`PageService`) and the frontend Save-gate (`WidgetEditor`).

### Changed

- **Translation polish from reviewer feedback** (thanks @rakekniven and the Nextcloud translators). Added `TRANSLATORS:` context hints for the Photo Story layout-style names (Magazine / Apple / Travelogue) so they're not translated literally; renamed the admin heading "Video embed domains" → "Domains for embedding videos"; fixed "Popup blocked. Please allow popups…" → "Pop-up blocked. Please allow pop-ups…"; and updated the app description to say "Team folders" (the current Nextcloud user-facing name) instead of "GroupFolders". The feed-URL example placeholder is no longer a translatable string. Ships with refreshed community translations (de, de_DE, et_EE, pt_BR, and others).

## [1.8.2] - 2026-07-08 — Recommended-language fallback on the landing page

### Changed

- **Faster group lookups.** Permission checks now use Nextcloud's `getUserGroupIds()` instead of loading full group objects, avoiding unnecessary object hydration on the hot permission path ([#74](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/pull/74), thanks @carlschwan).

### Fixed

- **Users whose language has no content are shown the recommended language instead of a blocking notice** ([#75](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/75)). The admin settings promise "if there is none, they are shown the recommended language below", but the landing page ignored the recommended (primary) language entirely and only ever fell back to English — and since 1.7.0 it showed a full-screen "No content in your language yet" notice even when English (or any recommended language) had content. The page now resolves the language to show as: the user's own language (if it has content) → the admin-configured recommended language (if it has content) → English → and only when *nothing* can be served does the notice appear. Authoring is unaffected: an editor still creates and saves pages in their own language, never the fallback. Also fixed the notice's "Manage intranet languages" button, which deep-linked to the old Demo data tab instead of the new Languages tab.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-07-07 — Admin settings tidy-up + read-only permission fixes

### Changed

- **Intranet languages now have their own admin settings tab.** Choosing which languages the intranet holds content in — the "languages with content" list, the recommended (fallback) language, and add/remove language — was buried under the **Demo data** tab, where nobody looked for it. It is now a dedicated **Languages** tab, sitting alongside Video services / Engagement / Publication as a peer "how the intranet behaves" setting. The old tab is renamed **Demo content** and now holds only the demo-install table, so its name is honest. To avoid growing the tab bar, the rarely-visited **Maintenance** tab (orphaned Team folder data) becomes a sub-tab under **Support** — both are infrequent operator tasks. Old `#maintenance` deep-links and the orphaned-data banner still work: they now open Support → Maintenance.

### Fixed

- **The recommended language can only be one that has content** ([#73](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/73)). The recommended (fallback) language picker previously listed every language, so an admin could point the fallback at a language with no pages — leaving users whose own language has no content staring at an empty intranet. The picker now offers only languages that have content (plus English, the universal source/fallback), and the backend rejects setting the recommended language to one without content (`POST /api/languages/primary` returns 400).
- **The "Edit page" button now hides for read-only Team Folder members** ([#70](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/70)). Even after the 1.8.0 permission hardening, a read-only member (e.g. an "IntraVox User" group with view-only access) still saw the Edit button and only hit a 403 on save. Two causes: (1) a page's `canWrite` was derived from the page **folder**, which a read-only Team Folder can report as writable, while the actual save preflights the page **file** — so the button and the save disagreed. `canWrite`/`canEdit` are now gated on the file the write path targets, matching reality. (2) A page's per-user permissions were baked into a distributed cache shared across users, so an editor's `canWrite` could be served to a read-only user (and vice-versa) for up to an hour; permissions are now recomputed per request and never cached, while the expensive page content stays cached. `canCreate`/`canDelete` remain folder-level as before.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-07 — Page management from the UI: delete, reorder, move, copy + configurable homepage

Editors can now manage the page structure directly from the IntraVox UI, without touching the underlying folders. This release also hardens IntraVox on **Team Folders**: read-only members are handled correctly, and setup/demo-import now work on installations with **primary object storage**.

### Added

- **Reorder and move pages from the structure view** ([#69](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/69)). The page-structure modal gains a **Manage structure** mode with per-row controls: **move up / move down** to reorder a page among its siblings, **move to another page** to relocate a page (with its whole subtree) under a different parent, and **delete** (with the existing confirmation). The home page stays pinned — it cannot be moved, reordered or deleted. All controls respect Nextcloud permissions: you only see them where you have write access, and cross-department moves obey GroupFolder ACLs.
  - Sibling order is persisted in a new per-page `order` field. Installations that have never reordered keep their existing order untouched (a stable comparator leaves pages without an explicit order in filesystem sequence), so this is a no-op until an editor first reorders.
  - New endpoint `POST /api/pages/reorder`; cross-parent moves use the existing `POST /api/bulk/move` (admin-only for now). Moving keeps the page's `uniqueId`, so internal links and URLs by id stay valid; a folder-name collision at the destination gets a `-2`/`-3` suffix.
- **Configurable homepage.** Any root-level page can be made the homepage from the page-structure manage mode ("Set as homepage"), and the current homepage is marked with a **Home** badge. The homepage is now a per-language pointer (`homepage.json`) rather than a hardcoded `home.json`, so no page needs to be renamed. The homepage cannot be deleted or moved until another page is assigned (returns `HOMEPAGE_PROTECTED`, surfaced as a clear notice). Fully back-compatible: installs without a pointer keep using the legacy `home.json`; the old homepage is lazily normalized into a regular folder page (keeping its `uniqueId`, so links survive) the first time a different page is set as home. New endpoint `POST /api/homepage`.
- **Copy page.** Duplicate a page as a new draft from the top-right "⋯" menu (copies the current page) or per-row in the page structure. The copy gets a fresh `uniqueId`, keeps the layout and media, is titled "… (copy)", and never inherits the homepage role. New endpoint `POST /api/pages/copy`.
- **Delete page in the "⋯" menu.** The top-right page menu now has a "Delete page" action (with confirmation), hidden on the homepage and shown only where you have delete permission — matching SharePoint's page menu.

### Changed

- **Clearer separation of "Edit navigation" vs "Page structure".** The navigation editor now states up front that it only changes the links in the navigation bar and their order (not the actual pages), and the page-structure modal explains that its manage actions move the real pages and folders. Both modals lead with the same info banner and cross-reference each other, and the word "menu" (ambiguous) is gone in favour of "navigation bar". The "⋯" menu also closes when an item opens a modal. The page-structure modal also notes that only top-level pages can be set as the homepage (move a sub-page to the top level first).
- **Faster page-structure operations at scale.** Reordering siblings is now O(N) instead of O(N²) (it reads a parent's direct children in a single cached pass rather than walking the whole subtree per child), and bulk delete/move/update clear the distributed cache once per batch instead of once per item — noticeably quicker on large, deeply nested intranets. No behaviour change.

### Fixed

- **File Story widget now shows Whiteboard and FormVox files** ([#68](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/68)). The widget filtered files through a hardcoded document-mimetype allowlist that omitted Nextcloud Whiteboard (`application/vnd.excalidraw+json`) and FormVox forms (`application/x-fvform`), so those files were silently dropped from a picked folder. Both are now included — FormVox forms render with their real preview, whiteboards fall back to the mime-icon placeholder — and each groups under its own "Whiteboards" / "Forms" category. Also added `.odg` drawings (`application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.graphics`, grouped as "Drawings") and the `text/x-markdown` alias so `.md` files aren't dropped on installs that register markdown that way.
- **Page-structure modal labels now translate.** The tree modal and its rows used a wrapper that passed the app id as the translation key, so strings like "Collapse", "Expand" and "Current" rendered as literal "intravox". The wrapper now matches the rest of the app (`translate(app, text, vars)`), so those labels localize correctly.
- **Deleting a page by `uniqueId` now works.** `PageService::deletePage` resolved only legacy folder-name ids, so a delete request keyed on a `page-…` uniqueId (how the UI deletes) failed with "Page not found". It now resolves `uniqueId` first, then falls back to the folder id.
- **Read-only Team Folder members are handled correctly** ([#70](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/70)). On a Team Folder shared read-only to a group (no Advanced Permissions/ACLs), such users could open the editor and the Save then failed with a confusing HTTP 400. IntraVox now reports write/create/delete permission accurately (it combines Nextcloud's permission bits with the node's own `isUpdateable()`/`isCreatable()`/`isDeletable()`, which reflect the mount's writability), so the Edit button is hidden for read-only users and a write attempt returns a clean 403 instead of a 400. This also removes the follow-on Nextcloud core `ShareHelper` error. Reading navigation/homepage no longer tries to create the language folder for read-only users (which explained the intermittent "navigation not visible until permissions were adjusted").
- **Setup and demo-data import work with primary object storage** ([#71](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/71)). `intravox:setup` and the demo import resolved the Team Folder via the internal `/__groupfolders` storage path, which does not exist as a node when object storage is the primary backend, so setup failed with "Failed to access groupfolder". IntraVox now resolves the folder through a member's mounted view — the same storage-agnostic mechanism the rest of the app uses — with the legacy path kept only as a fallback for local storage.
- **The "Add widget" picker opens again** ([#72](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/72)). The widget picker crashed on open with `TypeError: this.t is not a function` because the component was missing the translation wrapper the rest of the app uses, so clicking "Add widget" appeared to do nothing. Adding the wrapper restores the picker.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-03 — Clearer landing page + VoxCloud language model + full language management + translation cleanup

When an editor maintained content only in one language (e.g. Dutch) and a user's Nextcloud language was set to another (e.g. English), the user silently saw a generic placeholder homepage — the editor's real work was invisible and there was no hint that this was a fallback. This release replaces that silent placeholder with a clear notice, gives admins full control over which languages the intranet holds content in, aligns the language handling with the wider VoxCloud model, and brings all source strings in line with the Nextcloud translation guidelines so the Transifex resource could be unlocked for translators.

### Added

- **Language fallback notice on the landing page.** If the user's own language has no real (editor-authored) homepage but another language does, IntraVox shows a clear `LanguageFallbackNotice` instead of the generic placeholder: it states the intranet has no pages in the user's language yet, lists the languages that *do* have content, and links to the user's Nextcloud personal settings so they can change their own language. New endpoint `GET /api/languages/content-status`.
- **Full content-language management in admin settings.** Admins can pick from **every Nextcloud-known language** (not only the subset IntraVox ships a translation file for), choose a **recommended (primary) language** used as the fallback suggestion, **add a language** (creates an empty homepage so editors can fill it), and **remove a language** with a confirmation dialog that warns how many pages will be deleted (the folder goes to the trash, restorable from Files). The fallback language (English) and the current recommended language are protected from removal. New endpoints `POST /api/languages/primary`, `POST /api/languages/{code}/add`, `DELETE /api/languages/{code}`.
- **UI translation-coverage indicator** next to each "Languages with content" chip, showing what share of the IntraVox interface is translated into that language (e.g. "UI 8%"), with a tooltip. `LanguageService::getTranslationCoverage()` computes it per base code (largest regional variant wins, e.g. `de` ← `de_DE.json`); `scripts/extract-en-json.js` writes a committed `l10n/.source-count.json` so the denominator is available at runtime.
- **Deep-linkable admin settings tabs.** Each admin settings tab is addressable via the URL hash (e.g. `…/settings/admin/intravox#demo`), and the tab updates the hash as you navigate.
- **`l10n/en.json` extractor** (`scripts/extract-en-json.js`, run via `npm run l10n:extract` / `npm run pot`). It scans `src/` and `lib/` for every `t()/n()/$t()/$n()` call and regenerates the English source for the POT, replacing the previous hand-maintained/restore-from-git workflow.

### Changed

- **"Active" languages are now derived from content, not an opt-in list.** A language is active once it has a homepage; the `enabled_languages` opt-in checkbox grid is replaced by a "languages with content" view plus add/remove controls. Real (editor-authored) content is told apart from auto-generated placeholders via a `_generated` marker, dropped automatically the first time an editor saves the page. The admin chip list shows active languages (any homepage, including a freshly added placeholder), while the fallback notice keeps the stricter "real content" rule so a placeholder never masks "no content in your language".
- **Demo content table** now lists exactly the languages IntraVox ships bundled demo content for (Dutch, English, German, French), independent of the deprecated enabled-list (German was previously missing). Hint reworded accordingly.
- **Source strings aligned with the Nextcloud translation guidelines** ([#63](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/63)): sentence-case for headings/labels/buttons (e.g. "Demo Data" → "Demo data", "API Token" → "API token"), a non-breaking space before every ellipsis, "GroupFolder"/"Team Folder" → "Team folder" wording, real gettext plurals for relative-time and file-count strings, URL/placeholder values removed from `t()`, and the redundant translated language-name helper dropped (the picker uses Nextcloud's own localized names).
- **Complete Dutch, German and French UI translations bundled** (all ~1220 interface strings, including plurals). After the source-string cleanup the Transifex resource was re-provisioned without the earlier translation memory, so these are shipped in `l10n/` and also serve as translation memory for the next Transifex sync — the community can refine them online from a fully-translated baseline instead of from scratch.

### Fixed

- **"Add language" actually creates the content folder now.** It silently failed before: `LanguageHomepageService` wrote to `getUserFolder('intravox')`, but there is no `intravox` system user ("Backends provided no user object"), so nothing was written — while the UI optimistically showed "Language added". It now writes via `SetupService::getSharedFolder()` (the same GroupFolder path demo-data uses), and the frontend reads the real server state instead of guessing, surfacing an error if the write fails. Adding and removing a language now triggers a synchronous `groupfolders:scan` so the change shows up immediately in every user's view and the Files app — without it, an added folder stayed invisible and a removed one lingered as a stale entry until the next background scan.
- **3-letter language codes are no longer truncated.** Language codes were clipped to two letters (`substr($code, 0, 2)` / `[a-z]{2}` matching), so Asturianu (`ast`) became an invalid `as` folder that didn't match its real code. Base codes are now treated as 2–3 letters throughout (`ast`, `kab`, …), so adding/removing such a language creates and deletes the correct `ast/` folder.
- Bumped vulnerable dependencies (dompurify, form-data, markdown-it, ws); `npm audit` reports no vulnerabilities.

### Deprecated

- `enabled_languages` app-config and the `language#setEnabled` / `language#createEmptyHomepage` endpoints are deprecated. The config key is no longer written by the admin UI but is kept in the database for downgrade safety (it is simply ignored by 1.7.0 code).

## [1.6.1] - 2026-06-14 — Fix: app could not be enabled on Nextcloud 34

Bugfix release. IntraVox 1.6.0 declared Nextcloud 34 support but crashed on `occ app:enable intravox`:

```
Error: Call to undefined method OC\Server::getAppManager()
```

Nextcloud 34 removed the legacy `\OC::$server->getXxx()` getter shortcuts on `OC\Server`. The 1.6.0 NC34 audit only checked the public `OCP\*` API surface and missed these internal `OC\` getters, which were still called in `lib/`. During install the repair step (`SetupDemoData`) hits `SetupService::isGroupFoldersAppEnabled()`, so the crash aborted `app:enable` entirely.

### Fixed

- **App can be enabled on Nextcloud 34 again** ([#58](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/58)). Replaced every removed `\OC::$server->getXxx()` getter with dependency injection of the stable `OCP\*` interfaces across 11 files (`SetupService`, `PermissionService`, `ApiController`, `PageService`, `PhotoStoryController`, `PreviewController`, `LicenseService`, `DemoDataService`, `OrphanedDataService`, `ImportDemoDataCommand`, `ImportPagesCommand`). Getters migrated: `getAppManager` → `OCP\App\IAppManager`, `getUserManager` → `OCP\IUserManager`, `getDatabaseConnection` → `OCP\IDBConnection`, `getURLGenerator` → `OCP\IURLGenerator`, `getMimeTypeDetector` → `OCP\Files\IMimeTypeDetector`, `getConfig` → injected `OCP\IConfig`. These interfaces are unchanged across NC 32/33/34, so a single codebase keeps working on all three.

### Removed

- Dead `$nextcloudPath = '/var/www/nextcloud'` field in `SetupService` (unused, and wrong for non-default install layouts).
- Redundant `\OC::$SERVERROOT`-based demo-data path fallback in `DemoDataService::getBundledDemoDataPath()`; `IAppManager::getAppPath('intravox')` already resolves both `apps/` and `custom_apps/` layouts.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-13 — Nextcloud 34 + Transifex-ready translations + admin-curated language list

Major release with three themes: **Nextcloud 34 compatibility**, **community translations via Transifex**, and **admin-curated language activation**. Plus PhotoStory lightbox fullscreen + "Open in Files" originally drafted for 1.5.6 are folded into this release. **No data loss on upgrade — existing installs keep their four configured languages enabled by default.**

### Upgrade safety contract

This release respects seven rules so existing installs cannot break:

1. No language folder is ever deleted automatically — not on toggle-off, not on upgrade, not by cleanup.
2. Default for installs upgrading from 1.5.x is `["nl","en","de","fr"]` — exactly the previous hardcoded set.
3. The Version10600 migration only seeds the config key; it never creates or removes content folders.
4. English cannot be disabled — it is the guaranteed fallback for every code path.
5. License page-counts stay per-language and are not reset when a language is toggled.
6. Cache invalidation runs automatically when the admin changes the enabled set.
7. `occ upgrade` from 1.5.x → 1.6.0 produces zero user-visible changes (until the admin acts).

### Added

- **Nextcloud 34 compatibility declared** — `info.xml` now ships `<nextcloud min-version="32" max-version="34"/>`. Audit results: zero removed-in-NC34 OCP PHP APIs referenced in `lib/`; all five `OC.*` JS globals IntraVox uses (`OC.dialogs.filepicker`, `OC.MimeType.getIconUrl`, `OC.L10N.translate`, `OC.requestToken`, `OC.webroot`) remain functional in NC34 stable (deprecated, scheduled for migration in 1.7); bundled `@nextcloud/vue` (9.8.1) and Vue (3.5.22) match NC34's ship versions; PHP `>=8.2` matches NC34's `>=8.2 <8.6` requirement.
- **Transifex-ready translation pipeline** — IntraVox is now packaged for community translations via Nextcloud's [Transifex pool](https://app.transifex.com/nextcloud/nextcloud/intravox/) (`o:nextcloud:p:nextcloud:r:intravox`). New `.tx/config` + `.l10nignore` + `l10n/.gitkeep` + committed POT template enable the Nextcloud l10n sync-bot to open pull requests with new translations as they land. Resource provisioning requested via [docker-ci#951](https://github.com/nextcloud/docker-ci/issues/951). The four existing languages (NL/EN/DE/FR) continue to ship in `l10n/*.json` until the resource is online.
- **Admin-curated language list** — new "Available languages" section at the top of the Demo Data tab in admin settings. Each language IntraVox ships a translation for appears as a checkbox; the admin ticks which ones should be active in the intranet. Disabled languages disappear from IntraVox menus, navigation, and the demo-data table, but **all their content stays on disk** and reappears the moment the language is re-enabled. English is always enabled and cannot be unticked.
- **Empty homepage on language activation** — when an admin enables a new language (one without bundled full-intranet demo data), IntraVox creates an empty homepage in the content folder so the language is immediately usable. Idempotent: never overwrites existing content.
- **New `LanguageService`, `LanguageController`, `LanguageHomepageService`** under `OCA\IntraVox\Service\*` and `OCA\IntraVox\Controller\*` — the single source of truth for "what languages are shipped" (auto-discovered from `l10n/*.json`) versus "what languages are active" (admin-controlled, persisted in `oc_appconfig.intravox.enabled_languages`).
- **PhotoStory lightbox: "Open in Files" button** in the lightbox topbar, plus a clickable filename in the details panel. Both open the photo's parent folder in the Files app in a new tab. A new server-side endpoint `/api/photo-story/open-in-files?file_id=N` resolves the user-relative parent path (including federated/GroupFolder mountpoints) and 302-redirects to the Files view — the API's `path` field is storage-internal, so building the URL client-side would 404 on those mounts.
- **PhotoStory lightbox: swipe-down-to-close on mobile** — vertical swipe over 100px closes the lightbox, alongside the existing horizontal swipe for prev/next.

### Changed

- **All hardcoded `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` constants replaced** — 12 services that each defined their own copy of `['nl','en','de','fr']` (PageService, DemoDataService, LicenseService, NavigationService, SetupService, FooterService, SystemFileService, FeedService, OrphanedDataService, ExportService, PagePathHelper, plus 2 OCC commands) now read from the central `LanguageService`. License page-counts only enumerate enabled languages; RSS feeds only include enabled languages; the orphaned-data scan recognises any language that's ever been shipped or enabled so it can never accidentally flag legitimate content as orphaned.
- **Navigation fallback unified on English** — `NavigationService::getCurrentLanguage()` used to fall back to `'nl'` for unknown user-locales. It now falls back to the universal English default, matching the rest of the codebase and the Transifex source-of-truth.
- **`SetupService` upgrade migrations now language-aware** — `migrateResourcesFolders()`, `migrateTemplatesFolders()`, and `migrateVersioningFolders()` now iterate over admin-enabled languages and skip language folders that don't already exist on disk. The result: `occ upgrade` from 1.5.x → 1.6.0 touches exactly the four folders the install already had, never creates phantom folders for new Transifex-discovered languages.
- **Demo Data tab filters by enabled languages** — only ticked languages appear in the install-status table. The "Full intranet" content option remains bundled for NL+EN only; other enabled languages show "Homepage only" and use the empty-homepage flow.
- **POT generation uses Nextcloud's official `translationtool.phar`** — `scripts/generate-pot.js` is now a thin Node wrapper around the same binary the sync-bot runs (`create-pot-files` task). Zero drift between local extraction and what Transifex sees. Replaces a custom en.json-based extractor that produced inflated POTs containing ~820 stale msgids the bot would have stripped anyway.
- **Plural-form overrides** for JA/KO/ZH/TH/VI/ID (1 form), FR/PT (`n > 1`), PL/RU/UK/CS/SK (3 Slavic forms), SL (4 forms), AR (6 forms) — ported from IntroVox's `regenerate_js_translations.py` so non-Germanic languages render correctly when their `pluralForm` field is absent. Without these overrides Asian and Slavic translations rendered with the wrong plural rule.

### Fixed

- **PhotoStory lightbox: Nextcloud header overlapped the topbar** — the lightbox sat at `z-index: 100000` but the NC header (z-index 2000) stayed visible because parent containers create stacking contexts (transforms/filters) that trap `position: fixed` children. Wrapping the template in `<Teleport to="body">` escapes the trapped context; the lightbox now genuinely covers the full viewport.
- **PhotoStory lightbox: date/location pill unreadable against light photos** — the translucent pill background disappeared against bright photos (white walls, snow, paper). Darker background, stronger backdrop-blur with saturation, subtle border, heavier drop-shadow, plus a text-shadow fallback for browsers without `backdrop-filter`.
- **PhotoStory lightbox: body scroll-lock on open** — the page underneath could be scrolled with the trackpad while the lightbox was open. `body.style.overflow = 'hidden'` is now applied on open and restored on close.
- **PhotoStory lightbox: iOS notch / Android status bar in fullscreen** — topbar now uses `env(safe-area-inset-*)` padding so the close button doesn't hide behind the notch.

### Removed

- **Stray `l10n/*.po` files** — replaced by the canonical Transifex output path `translationfiles/<lang>/intravox.po`. The PO files in `l10n/` were never used by the Nextcloud runtime (which reads `.js` + `.json`) and only created dual-source confusion. Bundled translations remain in `l10n/{nl,en,de,fr}.json` until Transifex onboarding completes.
- **`PageService::SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` constant** — and 11 sibling constants across the service layer. All logic now routes through `LanguageService`.

### Internal

- **New migration `Version001600Date20260609000000`** — pure config-init, seeds `intravox.enabled_languages` with the legacy default on first upgrade. Idempotent.
- **`PagePathHelper` stays a pure helper** — its language-code set is static-class state synchronised once per request from `Application::boot()`. Avoids piping `LanguageService` through every caller of a previously side-effect-free helper.
- **`AdminSettings` initial state expanded** — admin UI receives `availableLanguages`, `enabledLanguageCodes`, and `defaultLanguage` server-side, no separate fetch needed on tab open.
- **RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md** rewritten with the full Transifex pipeline diagram and two adopted IntroVox v1.7.1 gotchas (GitHub-bot divergence, near-empty-language conflict resolution) so the next release doesn't repeat IntroVox's mistakes.
- **`scripts/generate-pot.js`** rewritten as wrapper around `translationtool.phar` (downloaded + cached under `scripts/.cache/` for 7 days).

### Notes

- The first Transifex sync PR will land **only after** a Nextcloud team member provisions `o:nextcloud:p:nextcloud:r:intravox` on the Transifex server. A GitHub issue on `nextcloud/docker-ci` requests this. Until then, translation files remain manually maintained for NL/EN/DE/FR.
- Disabled-language pages don't count toward the free-tier 50-pages-per-language limit. This is the intended behaviour: organisations get back unused-language capacity once they curate the list. Re-enabling a language re-counts.
- The bundled `LANGUAGE_META` map in `DemoDataService` still hardcodes display names and the "has full intranet demo" flag for NL/EN/DE/FR. New Transifex-shipped languages will appear in the admin UI with their base code as the name (e.g. "es") until they're added to the meta map. Cosmetic-only; activation and content management work either way.
- **Cosmetic legacy still in code**: five `OC.*` JavaScript globals (deprecated since NC 26-30) — migration to `@nextcloud/*` equivalents is planned for 1.7. Works on NC32-34 today, may break on NC35 if Nextcloud removes them.

## [1.5.5] - 2026-05-30 — Allow mailto / tel / sms links in Link widget

Patch release that fixes [#57](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/57): clicking-save on a Link widget item whose URL is `mailto:`, `tel:`, or `sms:` would silently empty the URL on save. After page refresh the link rendered as `#`. No DB migration, no API breaking changes.

### Fixed
- **Link widget: `mailto:`, `tel:`, and `sms:` URLs were stripped on save** ([#57](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/57)) — `Service\Sanitize\UrlSanitizer::sanitize()` only allowed `http(s)://`, root-relative paths, and `#` anchors. Any other scheme — including the universally-accepted communication shortcuts mailto/tel/sms — was rewritten to an empty string at save time. The widget then rendered `href="#"` after a page refresh, even though the in-memory edit showed the correct URL until then. The Navigation editor used a different sanitization path (`FILTER_SANITIZE_URL` without the scheme allowlist) which is why mailto links worked there but not in Link widgets. Allowlist extended to include `mailto:`, `tel:`, `sms:` — three schemes with no JavaScript execution path, part of the default allowlist of [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) and [HTMLPurifier](http://htmlpurifier.org/). `javascript:`, `data:`, `file:`, `xmpp:`, `matrix:`, and bare domains remain blocked. New unit tests cover both the accept and the continued-reject cases.

### Notes
- Existing Link widgets that lost their mailto/tel/sms URL still need to be re-edited and saved once — the empty value is persisted on disk. There is no automatic migration; once saved with 1.5.5 the URLs stick.
- `xmpp:` and `matrix:` remain blocked. They are safe in principle (no JS execution) but unlikely to be intentional in most intranets; add per-need with an explicit code review if you want them. Open an issue if your installation needs them.

## [1.5.4] - 2026-05-30 — Hide source folder for users without access, PhotoStory map z-index, NC look-and-feel parity

Patch release that closes an information disclosure issue introduced by 1.5.3.1, fixes a Leaflet/sticky-topbar layering bug, and brings the bundled `@nextcloud/vue` in line with what Nextcloud 33 itself ships so IntraVox widgets visually match NC's own apps again. No DB migration, no API breaking changes.

### Security
- **FileStory / PhotoStory: source folder path leaked to users without access** — 1.5.3.1 added a "You do not have access to this folder" empty-state that showed the configured folder path (e.g. `Shalution/Administratie/2026`) as context. For a user who is *deliberately excluded* from that folder, this disclosed the existence and naming of paths they shouldn't be aware of — path names can carry sensitive context (client names, project codes, person names, dated boundaries). The empty-state now renders a minimal lock icon + `"You do not have access to this widget"` with no folder name and no scan hint. The folder path remains visible only for users who *do* have access but happen to see an empty result (legitimate context).

### Fixed
- **PhotoStory: Leaflet map overlapped the sticky IntraVox topbar on scroll** — `PhotoStoryMap.vue` and `PhotoStoryDayMap.vue` had `position: relative` with no z-index, so Leaflet's internal panes (default z-index 200–700) rendered over `.intravox-topbar` (z-index 100) when the page scrolled past the map. Both map containers now establish their own stacking context with `position: relative; z-index: 0; isolation: isolate;`, capping the Leaflet panes below the topbar without touching Leaflet's own z-index conventions.
- **PageDetailsSidebar tabs visually diverged from NC Files** — IntraVox bundled `@nextcloud/vue` 9.5, while NC 33 ships 9.6+ with a refreshed sidebar-tab look. The result was a different (often "double-underline" feeling) active-tab rendering versus what users see in NC's own Files sidebar. Bumped the bundled `@nextcloud/vue` to `^9.6.0` (resolved to 9.8.1) so PageDetailsSidebar now renders identically to NC's own sidebar tabs.

### Changed
- **Bundled `@nextcloud/vue` upgraded** from 9.5.0 → 9.8.1 (within `^9.6.0` range, matching the version NC 33 itself bundles). No public IntraVox API changes; some `Nc*` components may have minor visual refinements that come along with the upgrade.

### Removed
- **Obsolete `.app-sidebar-tabs__nav` border-bottom override** — the 1.5.1-era CSS workaround in `css/main.css` was meant to fix a double-underline on `NcAppSidebarTabs` in NC 32+. With the `@nextcloud/vue` 9.6+ refresh that override became counter-productive (it removed the hairline that NC's new active-tab rendering visually anchors against, producing the misaligned look reported on 1.5.4-rc). The override has been removed; the look is now exactly what NC Files renders.

### Internal
- **RELEASE_CHECKLIST: new section 1b "Dependency parity with Nextcloud core"** — codifies the lesson from this release. Before tagging, check `node_modules/@nextcloud/vue/package.json` against the version NC ships for the target NC min-version (table maintained in the checklist). Visual canary: PageDetailsSidebar tabs vs. NC Files sidebar.

### Notes
- The defensive backend guard `PhotoStoryService::assertNotResolvedToUserRoot()` added in 1.5.3.1 stays in place. It already returns `reason: 'folder_not_accessible'` on the 404 response which the new empty-state branches on.
- Known follow-up: News widget's empty-state still shows `Source: {path}` for unauthorised users. Same pattern, lower severity (source is usually a page-id, not a filesystem path); tracked separately.
- Future direction: SharePoint-style **audience targeting** per widget will eventually let admins hide widgets entirely from users who shouldn't see them. The lock-state introduced here is the fallback for the edge-case where audience-target users lose folder permissions after configuration.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-05-30 — FileStory open in new tab + legacy GroupFolders fix

Patch release that fixes a "file no longer exists" toast when clicking documents in FileStory, and makes click-to-open behaviour consistent across all mount types. No DB migration, no API breaking changes.

### Fixed
- **FileStory: "file no longer exists" toast on click for legacy shared-storage GroupFolders** — `FileStoryWidget.openFile()` preferred `OCA.Viewer.open({path})` for inline preview, deriving the path from `file.path` by stripping a leading `files/`. That works for personal storage and per-folder jail GroupFolders, but in legacy shared-storage GroupFolders the cache row stores `__groupfolders/<id>/...` and the user-visible mount-point name (e.g. `Shalution`) isn't carried on the row. The Viewer received `/__groupfolders/4/Administratie/2026/Boekhouding.xlsx`, couldn't resolve it against the user's tree, and NC raised the "file no longer exists" toast. Federated shares hit a similar dead-end via a different code path.
- **FileStory click behaviour now consistent across mount types** — documents always open in a new tab via NC's `/f/<id>` handler, which resolves the right mount server-side for personal storage, both GroupFolders mount strategies, internal shares and federated shares. Removed the path-derivation entirely (`resolveDisplayPath()` deleted).

### Notes
- Behaviour change: clicking a document in FileStory no longer opens the inline NC Viewer overlay — every click now opens a new tab at the file's NC Files location. This trades inline-preview ergonomics for "actually works on every mount type" reliability.
- PhotoStory is unaffected; its widget uses an internal Lightbox component and never touched `OCA.Viewer.open()`.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-05-28 — PhotoStory groupfolder fix + federated previews + sticky navigation

Patch release with two production-blocking PhotoStory fixes (groupfolder albums and federated-file thumbnails), three UX improvements requested from real use, and one admin-tool clarification. No DB migration, no API breaking changes.

### Fixed
- **PhotoStory shows "No photos found" for every groupfolder album** — `PhotoStoryService::extractStorageAndPath()` returned the jailed Node path (e.g. `Albums/Doris Synchroonzwemmen`) while `oc_filecache.path` stores the unjailed form (`__groupfolders/7/Albums/Doris Synchroonzwemmen` or `files/Albums/Doris Synchroonzwemmen`, depending on which mount strategy the groupfolder uses). The SQL `path LIKE` predicate matched zero rows, the widget rendered its empty state, and the hint text misleadingly pointed admins at `occ files:scan` — even though the files were already indexed. The path is now reconstructed by walking the cache wrapper chain for the first `CacheJail::getGetUnjailedRoot()`, which covers both groupfolder mount layouts as well as any other jailed mount (federated, encryption-wrapped). Root-mode `/` enumeration also benefits — separate groupfolder mounts no longer collapse into the personal-storage scope.
- **PhotoStory/FileStory tile previews missing for federated files** — NC's `/core/preview` returns 404 for any file on a `Files_Sharing\External\Storage` mount: the preview providers (Image, Office, PDF) need a local file path or a Collabora/LibreOffice render, and federated files only exist on the remote NC's disk. Result: PDFs, docx, xlsx and even jpg tiles from an OCM share rendered as a generic mime-icon instead of a thumbnail. New shared `PreviewController` at `GET /api/preview?file_id=N&x=400&y=400` closes the gap: local files 302-redirect to `/core/preview` (no overhead, NC's own preview cache stays hot); federated files are handled by the new `FederatedPreviewService` which calls the **owner** instance's `/index.php/apps/files_sharing/publicpreview/{token}` endpoint and caches the result in `appdata/intravox/federated-preview/` keyed by `{fileId}-{etag}-{x}-{y}`. Cold response ~250–400 ms (~5–15 KB transfer per file, not the file body), warm ~180 ms.<br><br>Three protection layers stack to keep this scalable and friendly to the remote: a **per-user rate throttle** (`UserRateThrottle(600/min)`) bounds individual misuse; **in-flight deduplication** via NC's distributed cache ensures that 50 users opening the same uncached tile at once produce a single outbound HTTPS call (49 wait for the cache to materialise, then read); a **per-remote concurrency semaphore** (default 8 simultaneous outbound calls per remote host) prevents an IntraVox-server from saturating one owner instance and tripping its IP-throttle. When the cap is hit the request degrades gracefully to the mime-icon fallback. A companion `POST /api/preview/warmup` endpoint pre-warms up to 16 federated tiles per call; PhotoStoryWidget and FileStoryWidget call it fire-and-forget after every paged fetch so most tiles are already warm by the time the user scrolls into view. Bandwidth scales with viewed files, not with corpus size — fine on 1M-file federated mounts.

### Added
- **PhotoStory: hide RAW sidecars when a JPG/HEIC variant exists** — DSLRs and mirrorless cameras in "RAW + JPG" mode write two files per shot (`IMG_5432.CR2` + `IMG_5432.JPG`) that show up as visual duplicates in any folder view. New `hideRawDuplicates` widget option (default **on**) groups files by `(parent_dir, basename-without-extension)` and prefers the browser-displayable variant over the RAW. Covers Canon (CR2/CR3), Nikon (NEF/NRW), Sony (ARW), Adobe (DNG), Fujifilm (RAF), Olympus (ORF), Panasonic (RW2), Pentax (PEF), Samsung (SRW) and Sigma (X3F). Implemented as over-fetch + dedup + slice so paginated infinite scroll stays correct; `total` continues to count physical files (honest source-of-truth for storage cost).
- **Sticky page navigation** — header (title + Save/Edit) and navigation bar are now wrapped in a `position: sticky; top: 0` topbar so they stay reachable on long pages. Previously a 300-photo Photo Story timeline forced you to scroll all the way back up to reach another page. Dropdowns/megamenus continue to position via `getBoundingClientRect()`, so their placement is unaffected.
- **Orphaned GroupFolder admin: show what's actually in the folder** — the "Content" column used to render the literal "Unknown data" for non-IntraVox orphans, leaving admins to delete blind. `OrphanedDataService::analyzeOrphanedFolder()` now returns a `sampleContents` field with the first 8 top-level entries (name, type, size) sorted alphabetically, and the admin UI renders them as a small listing under the badge. The empty-state label also changes from "Unknown data" to "Non-IntraVox data" for accuracy ([#56](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/56)).

### Notes
- The PhotoStory groupfolder fix activates on every groupfolder-hosted album with zero config — existing widgets pointing at a groupfolder path will start returning their photos immediately after upgrade.
- The federated preview proxy degrades gracefully: if the owner instance can't produce a thumbnail (no Collabora/LibreOffice on their side, or the file format is unsupported there), the endpoint serves a 302 redirect to the matching mime-icon SVG. No broken-image placeholders.
- `hideRawDuplicates` defaults to enabled also for existing widgets (the param is absent → backend reads its default). Users with RAW-only albums can untick the new editor checkbox.
- No DB migration; widget configs are read back through the new optional field transparently.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-05-28 — Themed-row contrast + widget polish

Patch release that fixes legibility on themed page rows and tightens a handful of widget rough-edges that surfaced in production after 1.5.0. No new features, no API changes.

### Fixed
- **PhotoStory/FileStory contrast on dark row backgrounds** — filenames, day-headers and meta lines used `--color-main-text` (dark) regardless of the row's background colour. On `Primary` (`--color-primary-element`) rows that produced unreadable dark-on-dark text. Both widgets now accept `rowBackgroundColor` from the parent `Widget.vue` (closing a gap with the existing widgets that already consume it) and switch internal text + tile surfaces to a WCAG-paired colour set via two CSS variables (`--fs-text`/`--ps-text` + their muted siblings). Tile bodies become a tinted-glass card on dark rows instead of cutting a hard white rectangle through the coloured backdrop.
- **FileStory tile filenames invisible on dark rows** — regression from the same root cause: tile bodies kept their `--color-main-background` (white) while inheriting the now-white filename colour. Tile surfaces, hover state, preview-fallback bg and mime-icon placeholder all lift to translucent white on `fs--on-dark`.
- **Folder-path "/" silently collapses to empty after save** — `PageService::sanitizePath` strips leading/trailing slashes, so a configured PhotoStory/FileStory `folderPath = "/"` (root) was persisted as `""` and rendered as "no folder selected" after reload. New `sanitizeFolderPath()` wrapper preserves `/` (and `\`) as a meaningful "whole drive" marker before delegating to the generic sanitizer.
- **502/503 during page save** — entering edit mode after a FileStory widget existed triggered four expensive `folder=/` queries within ~250 ms (the legacy debounce). Apache workers saturated on large libraries. FetchKey watcher debounce raised from 250 ms to 700 ms in both widgets.
- **NcAppSidebarTabs double underline (NC 32 regression)** — `@nextcloud/vue` 8.x renders both a 1 px hairline on the tab-strip wrapper *and* a 4 px coloured indicator on the active tab, producing a stacked double underline in the PageDetailsSidebar. Global override in `css/main.css` removes the redundant hairline; scoped Vue CSS couldn't reach the `data-v-`-tagged third-party selector.
- **Photo previews missing for common web formats** — `PhotoStoryService::MEDIA_MIMES` was narrower than what users actually drop into their photo folders. Now also includes `webp`, `gif`, `svg+xml`, `bmp` and `video/webm`.
- **Empty folder picker returning `""` instead of `/`** — NC's `OC.dialogs.filepicker` returns an empty string when the user picks the root; both editors now normalise that to `"/"` so the configured value matches the sanitizer's accepted shape.

### Notes
- Default-themed rows (transparent / `--color-background-hover` / `--color-primary-element-light`) are visually unchanged; the new contrast logic only activates on saturated row colours.
- No DB migration. Existing PhotoStory/FileStory widget configs are read back through the new sanitizer transparently.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-27 — Photo Story + File Story widgets

Major release. Introduces two new widgets — **Photo Story** for photo galleries with EXIF, location maps and an Apple-style lightbox; **File Story** for document libraries with multi-mode layouts, MetaVox-aware filtering and federated-share awareness. Adds a fresh wave of perf, security, accessibility and l10n polish across the photo + file widget surface.

### Added — Photo Story Widget

- **Four layout modes**: Timeline (Magazine, Apple or Travelogue style), Highlights (auto-curated top photos), Grid (masonry), and On-this-day (year-over-year retrospective).
- **Lightbox** with keyboard navigation (Arrow/Home/End/Esc/Space), slideshow mode with adjustable speed, focus-trap and focus-restore for screen readers, semi-transparent date/location pill that toggles a mini-map for geo-tagged photos.
- **OpenStreetMap integration** via Leaflet: optional overview map per widget, per-day mini-maps in Timeline mode, and a cross-folder cluster endpoint for browsable map-driven storytelling. Admin-config aware (NC admin can disable all map features instance-wide).
- **EXIF metadata** rendered into a details flyout (people, subjects, camera, location). Reads from NC core `oc_files_metadata` when populated; falls back to the bundled `lsolesen/pel` reader as a last resort with a per-request eager-EXIF cap.
- **MetaVox-driven filtering, grouping and sorting** when the MetaVox app is installed. Supports cross-folder discovery mode (empty folder + ≥1 filter) for "all my photos tagged X across the instance".
- **Geocoding cache** with periodic warmup job for fast country/location lookup on GPS-bearing photos.

### Added — File Story Widget

- **Four layout modes**: Timeline (per-day / per-month / per-year granularity), List (flat sortable), Tiles (visual grid with first-page previews and three configurable sizes: Small/Medium/Large), and Grouped (by file-type or MetaVox field).
- **Federated-share awareness** — incoming OCM shares are detected per-file via a single indexed SQL join (`oc_storages × oc_share_external`). Federated rows render with a subtle cloud-badge and silently skip MetaVox-fetch since the remote NC has its own metadata database we cannot reach cross-instance. Mixed sources (local + federated under one root) keep full controls; pure-federated sources hide the MetaVox UI with an explanatory banner.
- **Configurable visible columns**: Date, File size, Folder path. Date column can render either filesystem mtime or EXIF/MetaVox `taken_at`. Filename + file-type icon are always present.
- **MetaVox filter-builder, sort, group-by** identical to Photo Story but adapted to document use-cases (e.g. group-by `archief_categorie` for compliance views).
- **Open-in-Files-viewer** click target on every row/tile with `role="button"`, Enter+Space keyboard activation and `aria-label` per item.

### Added — Page editor & widget plumbing

- **Widget registration** for Photo Story and File Story in the picker, with iconography and descriptive copy.
- **Editors** for both widgets with folder picker (NC FilePicker dialog), live capability detection (MetaVox available?, source-federated?), sortable filter builder with type-aware operators (`equals`, `contains`, `in`, `year_equals`), and persisted widget config validated by `PageService::sanitizeWidget`.
- **REST API** under `/api/photo-story/*` and `/api/file-story/*` covering paged listing, capabilities, MetaVox field discovery, location clusters, EXIF detail and range-aware video streaming (Photo Story only).

### Performance

- **Paged enumeration** via `oc_filecache` for all primary widget modes — no more full-tree `getDirectoryListing()` on large libraries. Hard caps (5000 cross-folder, 20k filtered, 200k count) prevent OOM on massive folders.
- **Federated detection** is one preloaded SQL query per request, O(1) lookups per file. The previous `IMountManager::findIn('/')` per-file approach, which did not scale on large libraries, is gone.
- **`clusters`, `highlights` and `on-this-day` endpoints** now go through `listPhotosPaged` with sane caps instead of the unpaged legacy path that risked the same blast radius as the federated-detect outage.
- **`filterFileIdsByScope` collapsed** from `chunks × scopes` SQL roundtrips to one ORed `WHERE` per chunk — at filtered-MetaVox-page scale this drops ~400 queries per page to ~40.
- **`extractGroupfolderId`** memoised per node within a request.
- **Frontend `AbortController`** on every fetch + fetchMore: rapid config changes no longer race stale responses overwriting fresh data, and pending requests cancel on widget unmount.

### Security

- **Per-file ACL guard** on the slice in MetaVox cross-folder hydration (`buildPagedResponseViaMetaVox`) using `$userFolder->getById()`. Bounded to ≤page-size lookups, so sub-folder ACLs inside groupfolders are honored.
- **Filter payload caps**: 16 KB JSON pre-decode rejection on both controllers, value-length cap of 200 chars per filter, max 32 filters and 64 array values per filter — prevents pathological-input DoS.
- **Generic 500 messages** on both controllers (no `$e->getMessage()` reaching client); folder-not-found mapped to clean 404 with empty-state payload instead of generic 500.

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)

- **Tiles, rows and hero elements**: `role="button"`, `tabindex="0"`, Enter + Space activation, meaningful `aria-label` derived from caption/location.
- **Lightbox**: focus-trap (Tab cycles within modal, no escape to background), focus-restore on close, counter announced via `aria-live="polite"`, icon-only buttons get descriptive `aria-label` + `aria-pressed` where appropriate.
- **Editors**: orphan `<label>` without `for=` converted to `<div class="editor-label">` to avoid mis-association; form controls properly labelled.
- **Reduced motion**: `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` honored for Ken-Burns animation, pulse skeletons, and pill transitions.
- **Status regions**: `role="status"` / `role="alert"` on loading, empty and error states; map-cluster list items keyboard-reachable; federated cloud-badge gets `role="img"` + `aria-label`.
- **Alt-text**: meaningful (caption / location / numbered fallback) instead of filename for photos; decorative `alt=""` for tile previews where the parent already labels the action.

### Internationalisation

- **Backend month/category labels** now route through `IL10N::t()` (`PhotoStoryService::localizedMonth`, `FileStoryController::extractGroupKey`). No more hardcoded Dutch in API payloads.
- **Frontend date formatters** use `getCanonicalLocale()` from `@nextcloud/l10n` everywhere — `toLocaleDateString` / `toLocaleString` / `Intl.DateTimeFormat` calls in PhotoStoryWidget, FileStoryWidget and PhotoLightbox no longer pin `nl-NL`.

### UX polish

- **Retry button** in the error-state of both widgets. Users recover from transient API failures without reloading the page.
- **Context-aware empty messages**: distinguishes "no folder selected" / "no documents match current filters" / "folder is empty".
- **Transparent date headers** in FileStoryWidget Timeline mode — replaces the opaque white sticky bar that clashed with themed/coloured rows. Count-badge uses `color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-primary-element) 14%, transparent)` for a subtle tinted chip that adapts to the active theme.

### Developer-side hardening

- **`scripts/check-import-consistency.js`** runs in `prebuild`: detects mixed sync/async imports of the same `.vue` component (the root cause of a runtime `TypeError` we hit on 2026-05-27) and fails the build before it ships.
- **`scripts/auto-bump-dev.js`** auto-bumps the patch level on dev deploys so NC's `md5(appVersion)` cache-buster always changes — browsers never serve a stale bundle after a deploy.
- **Translation files** (`en/nl/de/fr`) synced for all 122 new UI strings added by Photo Story + File Story.

### Notes

- **No DB migrations** required for the widget functionality itself; existing pages keep working.
- **PhotoStory federated-share awareness** is on the roadmap but not yet implemented (single-storage photo libraries are the typical case). FileStory has the full federated-aware code path.
- **MetaVox cross-instance sync** remains out of scope: NC core exposes no federation tokens or remote-file-id mapping. Roadmap item.

New Vue components: `src/components/PhotoStoryWidget.vue`, `src/components/PhotoStoryWidgetEditor.vue`, `src/components/PhotoLightbox.vue`, `src/components/PhotoStoryMap.vue`, `src/components/PhotoStoryDayMap.vue`, `src/components/PhotoStoryFilterBuilder.vue`, `src/components/FileStoryWidget.vue`, `src/components/FileStoryWidgetEditor.vue`.

Composer: `lsolesen/pel` added for the optional in-process EXIF reader.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-05-20 — Security dependency bumps

Patch release that resolves all open frontend security advisories flagged by GitHub Dependabot shortly after the v1.4.0 push. No functional or API changes — `npm audit fix` lifted eight vulnerable transitive packages to patched versions within their declared semver ranges, no `package.json` edits required. Build, PHPUnit (258/413) and dev-server smoke tests all green.

### Fixed
- **axios** → 1.16.1 — resolves 11 advisories (prototype pollution gadgets, CRLF injection, header injection, NO_PROXY/SSRF bypasses, DoS via deep `toFormData` recursion, streamed upload/response body-size bypasses, null-byte injection in `URLSearchParams`, XSRF token cross-origin leak)
- **dompurify** → 3.4.5 — resolves four XSS bypasses (`SAFE_FOR_TEMPLATES`/`RETURN_DOM`, `ADD_TAGS`/`FORBID_TAGS` short-circuit and function-form, prototype-pollution via `CUSTOM_ELEMENT_HANDLING`)
- **fast-uri** → 3.1.2 — path-traversal via percent-encoded dot segments + host-confusion via percent-encoded authority delimiters
- **fast-xml-builder** / **fast-xml-parser** — XML comment/CDATA injection and attribute-value quote-bypass
- **brace-expansion** → 5.0.6 — DoS via numeric range that defeated documented `max` protection
- **follow-redirects** → 1.16.1 — custom auth-header leak on cross-domain redirects
- **postcss** → 8.5.15 — XSS via unescaped `</style>` in CSS stringify output

After the bump `npm audit` reports zero vulnerabilities.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-19 — Enterprise refactor + caching foundation

This release lays down the foundation IntraVox needs to scale cleanly to Nextcloud Enterprise customers with thousands of users on multi-node deployments. Two themes: PageService gets split into focused, testable services, and the caching layer gains group-aware keys + a content-addressable distributed cache + a frontend prefetch pipeline.

User-visible: pages and navigation are noticeably faster on warm caches, especially for groups of users that share the same permission profile. Cold-cache latency is bounded by a new background warmup job. No breaking changes; every public API is unchanged.

### Added
- **Subtree support on `GET /api/pages/tree`** — Optional `rootPageId` query parameter narrows the response to the subtree rooted at the page with that uniqueId. Resolves [#45](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/45) from JustinDoek (teamhub app builder) who previously had to combine `listPages` + `getBreadcrumb` to list pages under one anchor. Backward compatible — without the parameter the full tree is returned as before. The same parameter is available on the `<PageTreeSelect>` Vue component (`rootPageId` prop) for in-app subtree pickers (`lib/Service/Path/PagePathHelper.php::findSubtree`, `lib/Service/PageService.php`, `lib/Controller/ApiController.php`, `src/components/PageTreeSelect.vue`)
- **ETag / 304 conditional responses on `GET /api/pages/{id}`** — Browser revalidation now returns a 304 with zero body when the cached page is still current. Per-user group hash is included in the ETag so a permission change automatically invalidates the cached entry without leaking content across users (`lib/Http/EtagBuilder.php`, `lib/Controller/HasConditionalResponse.php`, `lib/Controller/ApiController.php`)
- **Group-hash cache key for page tree + permission map** — Tree and navigation caches are now keyed by a hash of the user's group memberships instead of their user-id. At enterprise scale (1000+ users in ~10 groups) this turns thousands of cache entries into dozens — same correctness, two orders of magnitude less memory. Permission path-maps are cached per-language (one entry per supported language, shared across all users) (`lib/Service/GroupContextService.php`, `lib/Service/PageService.php`, `lib/Service/PermissionService.php`)
- **Event-based cache invalidation on group changes** — Adding or removing a user from a group flushes the affected distributed caches via `UserAddedEvent` / `UserRemovedEvent` listeners. Group permission updates propagate within one request cycle instead of waiting for TTL expiry (`lib/Listener/GroupMembershipChangedListener.php`)
- **Page-content distributed cache with mtime-indexed keys** — Sanitized page output is cached under `content_{uniqueId}_{mtime}`; a write bumps mtime, the next reader misses cache and rebuilds. The expensive sanitize-pipeline (~500 lines of widget processing) only runs on cache miss (`lib/Service/PageService.php`)
- **News widget result cache with version counter** — `getNewsPages()` results are cached per `{lang}_{groupHash}_v{counter}_{paramHash}`. Mutations clear the cache; subsequent reads rebuild from a fresh counter state (`lib/Service/PageService.php`)
- **Frontend prefetch service** — `src/services/PrefetchService.js` speculatively loads pages on hover (desktop, 100ms delay) and IntersectionObserver entry (mobile, 200px rootMargin). Respects `navigator.connection.saveData` so users on metered connections aren't surprised by extra requests; max 3 concurrent in-flight requests. Writes through the existing `CacheService` so real navigations pick up the prefetched data instantly
- **LRU eviction on localStorage quota** — `CacheService.set()` now catches `QuotaExceededError`, drops the persistent entry with the earliest expiry, and retries once. Prevents silent cache-write failures on heavy intranets
- **Background cache-warmup job** — Runs every 15 minutes (TIME_INSENSITIVE) and pre-warms the path-map + tree + navigation caches for each supported language. Prevents the cold-cache thundering herd after a deploy or after a page mutation (`lib/BackgroundJob/CacheWarmupJob.php`)
- **`RequestTimer` infrastructure** — Light static utility for measuring p50/p95 latency of expensive operations. Used internally for ad-hoc profiling; not yet wired into TelemetryService (`lib/Performance/RequestTimer.php`)

### Changed
- **PageService.php is 615 lines smaller** — From 6135 to ~5520 lines. Ten pure helpers extracted into focused, individually-testable services. PageService remains the orchestrator for filesystem + cache + permissions, but the sanitize, format, search, path and template logic now live in dedicated modules:
  - `lib/Service/Sanitize/HtmlSanitizer.php` (strip_tags + style-property whitelist + entity decode)
  - `lib/Service/Sanitize/UrlSanitizer.php` (schema-whitelist for link URLs)
  - `lib/Service/Sanitize/ColorSanitizer.php` (NC theme-vars + hex + rgb/rgba)
  - `lib/Service/Sanitize/MediaSanitizer.php` (filename + SVG + image-header validation)
  - `lib/Service/Version/PageVersionFormatter.php` (NC-style "X sec/min/hour/day ago" + metadata accessors)
  - `lib/Service/Template/TemplateMetadataExtractor.php` (preview summary: column count, widget mix, complexity bucket)
  - `lib/Service/News/NewsContentExtractor.php` (excerpt, first-image, markdown strip)
  - `lib/Service/Search/PageSearchHelper.php` (snippet extraction, per-widget-type scoring)
  - `lib/Service/Path/PagePathHelper.php` (depth, page-type, department slug, current-page marking)
  - `lib/Service/Util/PageIdUtils.php` (sanitizeId, RFC 4122 v4 UUID, php.ini size parsing, formatBytes)
- **Test suite grew from 78 (with 36 errors) to 252 / 401 assertions, all green** — Existing Controller tests were updated to match the current constructor signatures; a fresh unit-test layer covers every extracted service

### Fixed
- **Cache-invalidation gaps closed across page/nav/media/import flows** — Discovered during dev verification of the new caching layer: several mutation paths wrote to disk without flushing the distributed caches introduced by PR-3 / PR-12 / PR-13, so changes were invisible for up to 5 minutes after a save. Now resolved:
  - `PageService::createPage` flushes after writing — without this, the new page sat behind the 5-minute tree-cache TTL (visible on "Create from template" — page appeared in the breadcrumb but the editor mounted blank until reload).
  - `PageService::createPageFromTemplate` re-fetches through `getPage()` so the response includes `enrichWithPathData` + the sanitize pipeline. Previously the API returned half-populated page data and the editor rendered blank until a manual save round-tripped through the real read path.
  - `App.vue::handleCreatePageFromTemplate` uses the enriched backend response directly instead of doing a second `selectPage()` round-trip that occasionally 404'd against a freshly-created folder and bounced the user back to the home page. URL hash, local pages array and frontend `CacheService` are all warmed in one synchronous block before the editor mounts.
  - `ImportService::importFromZip` flushes all PageService caches after a bulk import — without this, 50+ imported pages were invisible in tree, navigation and news widgets for the next 5 minutes.
  - `NavigationService::saveNavigation` flushes `intravox-pages` + `intravox-permissions` after writing — previously a menu edit landed on disk but the path-map cache (PR-3) served the old menu for 5 minutes.
  - `PageService::uploadMedia` + `uploadMediaWithOriginalName` flush the per-page content cache so the next page-render reflects the just-uploaded asset (important for image overwrites where users otherwise got the cached old version back).
  - Public `PageService::invalidateAllCaches()` introduced as the cross-service hook for the import path (kept internal `clearCache()` private; only the audit-driven external use case opens it up).
- **Actionable error messages on failed ZIP imports** — Resolves [#52](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/52) from @apesorguk, who saw only "Import failed. Please check the ZIP file format and try again" when uploading a cloudron Nextcloud backup. The five validation errors in `ImportService` (invalid ZIP, missing export.json, invalid JSON, unsupported version, incomplete export) now bubble through a typed `InvalidImportException` and reach the user with copy that tells them what went wrong and how to fix it ("Make sure you uploaded an IntraVox export, not a Nextcloud Files backup..."). HTTP status is now 400 for these instead of 500. Generic failures still hide behind an `errorId` so server paths don't leak. A `NcNoteCard` above the import form spells out the supported format up front. Error messages translated to NL/DE/FR via a stable `errorCode` (`INVALID_ZIP`, `MISSING_EXPORT_JSON`, `INVALID_JSON`, `UNSUPPORTED_VERSION`, `INCOMPLETE_EXPORT`) the frontend maps to localized strings (`lib/Exception/InvalidImportException.php`, `lib/Service/ImportService.php`, `lib/Controller/ApiController.php`, `lib/Controller/ImportController.php`, `src/components/AdminSettings.vue`)
- **Broken Controller test suite** — `ApiControllerTest`, `BulkControllerTest`, `AnalyticsControllerTest` now compile against the current Controller constructor signatures. The OCP stub gained `ISession`, `ICache`, `ICacheFactory`, `IGroup`, group-membership events and `Files_Versions\IVersion` to keep unit tests runnable without a full Nextcloud install

## [1.3.4] - 2026-05-08 — Version bump for upgrade path

Identical content to 1.3.1 (released earlier today). The version number is bumped to 1.3.4 because an internal 1.3.3 build was published to the App Store on 2026-05-06; instances that picked up that build would not see 1.3.1 as an upgrade. 1.3.4 ensures every existing install gets the editor/table improvements and the privacy cleanup of [1.3.1] below.

No code changes vs. 1.3.1.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-05-08 — Editor, telemetry & table improvements

### Added
- **Text alignment** — New alignment dropdown in the text editor toolbar (left, center, right). Alignment persists through save/reload using CSS classes in markdown storage. Supports paragraphs and headings. Keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+Shift+L/E/R`. Custom TipTap extension uses CSS classes instead of inline styles for DOMPurify compatibility (`textAlignExtension.js`, `InlineTextEditor.vue`, `markdownSerializer.js`)
- **Blockquote button** — New blockquote toggle button in the text editor toolbar. Uses the existing StarterKit blockquote extension — only the toolbar button and read-only styling were missing (`InlineTextEditor.vue`, `Widget.vue`, `Footer.vue`)
- **Nextcloud Extended Support telemetry** — Telemetry payload now includes `hasExtendedSupport` (boolean), sourced from Nextcloud's public `OCP\Util::hasExtendedSupport()` API. Helps us understand which share of IntraVox installations runs on Nextcloud Enterprise / Extended Support — relevant for compatibility prioritization and the Nextcloud ISV partnership. Falls under the existing telemetry opt-out (no separate consent), and is listed in the admin "What we collect" overview for transparency. No personal data, just a single yes/no per instance (`TelemetryService.php`, `SupportSettings.vue`)
- **Persistent column widths in tables** — Column widths an editor sets by dragging the TipTap resize handles now survive save/reload. A post-render hydrator in `markdownSerializer.js` builds a `<colgroup>` from `data-colwidth` (modern) or `colwidth` (legacy) cell attributes and any pre-existing `<col style="width: Xpx">`, then converts pixel widths to percentages so the table always fits its container — even when the saved widths sum higher than a narrow page-row column. Tables without explicit widths keep the previous auto-layout behaviour (`markdownSerializer.js`)
- **Table width presets** — New "Width" row in the table toolbar dropdown with presets Auto, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%. Stored as `data-table-width` on the `<table>` (`InlineTextEditor.vue`)
- **Table alignment** — New "Alignment" row in the same dropdown with Left/Center/Right buttons. Stored as `data-table-align`; rendered as `margin-left: auto` / `margin-right: auto` so a 50%-wide table can sit left, centered, or right with surrounding text (`InlineTextEditor.vue`)
- **Free-form table width drag handle** — A custom ProseMirror plugin adds an 8px-wide drag area on the right edge of the active table. Click+drag to set any pixel width between 80px and the widget container's width; the resulting style survives save/reload via the same hydrator. Coexists with the column-resize handles inside the table — different hit zones (`tableResizeHandle.js`, `InlineTextEditor.vue`)
- **Horizontal scroll wrapper for wide tables** — Tables wider than their page-column scroll horizontally inside a `.tableWrapper` div instead of pushing the page layout sideways. Read-mode wraps every table via the hydrator; edit-mode reuses TipTap's built-in `.tableWrapper` element with the same styling, so what the editor sees matches what readers get (`markdownSerializer.js`, `Widget.vue`, `InlineTextEditor.vue`)

### Changed
- **Toolbar reordered** — Text editor toolbar reorganized into logical groups based on analysis of 10 popular editors: (1) Inline formatting: B, I, U, S (2) Block structure: Heading, Lists, Blockquote (3) Alignment dropdown (4) Insert actions: Link, Table. Compact mode follows the same grouping in the "More" dropdown (`InlineTextEditor.vue`)
- **Alignment as dropdown** — Text alignment uses a single dropdown button (like the heading dropdown) instead of 3 separate buttons. The button icon dynamically reflects the active alignment. Keeps the toolbar compact on all screen sizes (`InlineTextEditor.vue`)
- **Telemetry includes license key for Enterprise claim verification** — `TelemetryService::collectData()` now adds the configured license key (or empty string for community instances). The license server uses it to verify `hasExtendedSupport` claims against the bound `license_usage` row before honoring them; without this binding the boolean would be anonymously spoofable. The key is the same value the app already sends to license validation/usage endpoints, so this introduces no new disclosure (`TelemetryService.php`)
- **Table cell text wrap policy** — Cells use `overflow-wrap: anywhere` (CSS Text Module Level 3) so long unbreakable tokens (URLs, hashes) wrap mid-word when needed. Edit-mode and read-mode use the same rules so what the editor sees is what readers get. Replaces the deprecated `word-break: break-word` combo with the modern one-line equivalent (`InlineTextEditor.vue`, `Widget.vue`)
- **Page rows allow narrow content** — `.page-row`, `.row-content`, `.page-grid` got `min-width: 0` and `max-width: 100%` so a wide table inside a multi-column row no longer forces the row beyond its viewport. The grid columns now use `repeat(N, minmax(0, 1fr))` instead of `repeat(N, 1fr)` so a `1fr` track can shrink below its content's min-content (`PageViewer.vue`, `PageEditor.vue`)

### Fixed
- **Aligned text not surviving save/reload** — Content with text alignment was escaped to raw HTML after saving and reloading. Root cause: `markdownToHtml()` had a validation check (`html === preservedMarkdown`) that incorrectly treated HTML blocks passed through by `marked` as a parse failure, triggering `escapeHtml()`. Fixed by skipping this check when content starts with `<` (`markdownSerializer.js`)
- **Table widths and alignment getting stripped on save** — `data-table-width` and `data-table-align` were not in the DOMPurify allowlist, so user-set widths and alignment from the table dropdown silently disappeared after saving. Added to the allowlist together with the `<div>` tag we now use for the scroll wrapper (`markdownSerializer.js`)
- **Text overflowing table cells** — In fixed-layout tables, long text in a cell could push past the cell border into the next column or beyond the table edge. Multi-cause fix: paragraphs and headings inside cells get `min-width: 0; max-width: 100%`, cells get `white-space: normal` (overrides a Nextcloud core rule that set `nowrap` on `<p>`), and the entire page-row chain was given proper `min-width: 0` so a wide table can no longer push its ancestors sideways (`InlineTextEditor.vue`, `Widget.vue`, `PageViewer.vue`, `PageEditor.vue`)
- **TipTap auto-generated table widths preventing fit-to-container** — TipTap writes `<table style="width: 422px">` based on summed colwidths; in narrow page-row columns this pinned the table beyond its container even with `table-layout: fixed`. The hydrator now strips that auto-style and rebuilds only from user-set `data-table-width` (`markdownSerializer.js`)

### Removed
- **Organization name & contact email from telemetry** — `organizationName` and `contactEmail` fields are no longer included in the telemetry payload sent to `licenses.voxcloud.nl/api/telemetry/report`. These were the only direct identifiers in an otherwise pseudonymous payload, so removing them brings telemetry closer to true anonymity. The fields had no functional purpose for telemetry — the license server doesn't use them — and no direct identifiers remain (`TelemetryService.php`)
- **"Your organization (optional)" admin settings section** — Removed the corresponding UI section, Vue state, and `GET`/`POST /api/settings` endpoints from `LicenseController`. Pre-existing `organization_name` / `contact_email` config values remain in `oc_appconfig` on upgraded instances but are no longer read or transmitted; they can be cleaned up in a future migration (`SupportSettings.vue`, `LicenseController.php`, `routes.php`)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-21 — Feed widget & performance

### Added
- **Feed widget** — New widget type for displaying external content on intranet pages. Supports RSS/Atom feeds and admin-configured connections to external systems (Canvas, Moodle, Brightspace, Jira, Confluence, SharePoint, OpenProject, and custom REST APIs). Features include: list and grid layouts (2-4 columns), configurable display options (image, date, excerpt, source, author), per-user OAuth2 personalization for LMS content, OIDC auto-connect for zero-click SSO, manual token fallback, 15-minute server-side caching, and public share support (`FeedWidget.vue`, `FeedWidgetEditor.vue`, `FeedReaderService.php`, `FeedItem.vue`)
- **Feed widget: connection presets** — Administrators configure connections in Admin Settings using platform presets that auto-fill endpoint paths, auth methods, and response field mapping. Presets available for Canvas, Moodle, Brightspace, Jira, Confluence, SharePoint, OpenProject, AFAS, TOPdesk, and Custom REST API. Each preset supports platform-specific content types (e.g. News/Courses/Deadlines for LMS, Pages/Documents/Lists for SharePoint, Bugs/Recent/Created for Jira)
- **Feed widget: content type selection** — Widget editors choose what content to display per connection type. LMS connections offer News/Announcements, My Courses, and Upcoming Deadlines. SharePoint offers Pages/News, Documents, and List items (with library/list selector). Jira offers project filtering and content types (bugs, recent, created). Content type selection happens in the widget editor, not admin settings
- **Feed widget: SharePoint integration** — Full Microsoft Graph API integration via OAuth2 client_credentials flow. Automatic token acquisition and caching using tenant ID, client ID, and client secret. Supports SharePoint site ID resolution (hostname:/path: format), page/news listing, document libraries, and list items. Admin configures site URL + Entra ID credentials; editors choose content type and library in the widget
- **Feed widget: image proxy** — Secure HMAC-signed image proxy bypasses Nextcloud CSP restrictions for feed images. Supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, AVIF, SVG (with sanitization via enshrined/svg-sanitize), and ICO. Daily signature rotation with yesterday grace window. All feed images (RSS, LMS, SharePoint, Jira) are proxied automatically (`FeedReaderController.php`, `FeedReaderService.php`)
- **Feed widget: OAuth2 account linking** — Users can connect their personal LMS account via OAuth2 popup flow (Canvas, Moodle with local_oauth2 plugin, Brightspace). Connected users see personalized content from their own courses. Token refresh is automatic (`LmsOAuthService.php`, `LmsOAuthController.php`, `LmsTokenService.php`, `OidcTokenBridge.php`)
- **Feed widget: sort and filter** — Feed items can be sorted by date or title (ascending/descending) and filtered by keyword. Filter searches in title, excerpt, and author (case-insensitive). Applied server-side after caching for instant response
- **Feed widget: custom request headers** — REST API connections support configurable HTTP headers (key-value pairs). Enables Nextcloud OCS API integration (`OCS-APIRequest: true`) and other systems requiring custom headers
- **Feed widget: design principle** — IntraVox focuses on organizational content (news, team updates, external feeds). Personal Nextcloud data (activities, notifications, recent files, Talk, Deck, Mail) belongs on the Nextcloud Dashboard. IntraVox does not duplicate Dashboard functionality. For organizational Nextcloud data from remote instances, use the REST API (custom) source type with OCS API endpoints
- **Calendar widget: external ICS feeds** — Editors can add external ICS calendar URLs (e.g. from Moodle, Canvas, Brightspace) directly in the calendar widget. Events from these feeds are visible to all page visitors, including public share viewers. No Nextcloud Calendar subscription required per user. Supports up to 5 ICS feeds per widget with 30-minute caching (`ExternalIcsService.php`, `CalendarWidgetEditor.vue`)
- **Calendar widget: LMS event deep links** — Clicking an external calendar event opens the event in the source LMS. Supports Canvas (native URL field), Brightspace (URL constructed from UID), and Moodle (URL constructed from UID). Unknown sources link to the feed domain
- **Feed widget: singleflight lock** — Prevents thundering herd on cache expiry. When the feed cache expires, only the first request fetches from the external source; concurrent requests wait and read from the freshly populated cache. Uses a distributed lock with unique request ID verification (`FeedReaderService.php`)
- **Feed widget: circuit breaker** — After 3 consecutive failures for a feed source, the circuit breaker opens and returns immediately with "temporarily unavailable". Resets automatically after 5 minutes or on first successful fetch. Prevents cascade failures from unstable external sources
- **Feed widget: background refresh** — New `FeedRefreshJob` background job proactively refreshes configured feed connections every 10 minutes, before cache expiry. Users almost never trigger a cold fetch. Includes its own circuit breaker to skip failing sources
- **Feed widget: rate limiting** — `UserRateThrottle(30/min)` on authenticated feed endpoints, `AnonRateThrottle(30/min)` on public share feed endpoint (`FeedReaderController.php`)
- **Page metadata database index** — New `intravox_page_index` table stores pre-indexed page metadata (title, uniqueId, path, language, status, modification time). Eliminates O(N) filesystem traversals for page listing, tree, and search operations. Updated automatically on page create/update/delete (`PageIndexService.php`, `Version001300Date20260420000000.php`)
- **Nextcloud search: index-first** — The unified search provider (Ctrl+K) now queries the page metadata index for fast title-based results (~1ms), with fallback to full-text filesystem search for content matches (`PageSearchProvider.php`)
- **Distributed page tree cache** — Page tree is cached in Redis/APCu (distributed) in addition to the existing in-process static cache. Shared across PHP processes/requests for ~70% reduction in tree response time. Invalidated automatically on page create/update/delete (`PageService.php`)
- **People widget: scalability guardrails** — Hard cap of 5,000 users on the unscoped filter path to prevent OOM/timeout on large Nextcloud instances. Filter results cached in Redis/APCu for 1 hour. Batch status prefetching reduces API calls from N to 1 (`UserService.php`)
- **Rate limiting on mutating endpoints** — `UserRateThrottle` added to page create/delete (10/min), bulk operations (5/min), comments (20/min), reactions (30/min), and analytics tracking (60/min). Covers `ApiController`, `BulkController`, `CommentController`, `AnalyticsController`
- **GDPR user deletion handler** — `UserDeletedListener` automatically cleans up analytics records, page locks, feed tokens, and LMS OAuth tokens when a Nextcloud user is deleted (`UserDeletedListener.php`, `Application.php`)
- **Audit logging** — Administrative operations logged with `IntraVox Audit:` prefix for SIEM integration: bulk delete/move/update (with page IDs and user), license key changes, organization settings, engagement settings (`BulkController.php`, `LicenseController.php`, `ApiController.php`)
- **Health check endpoint** — `GET /apps/intravox/api/health` returns app status and version for monitoring and orchestration (Kubernetes, uptime monitoring)
- **Scalability documentation** — New [SCALABILITY.md](docs/admin/scalability.md) documenting all performance, caching, resilience, rate limiting, and enterprise features
- **Admin: connection test button** — "Test connection" button on each feed connection card verifies credentials and endpoint by fetching a preview from the external API
- **Admin: connection export/import** — Export all feed connections as JSON (without tokens/secrets). Import on another instance with duplicate detection and preview dialog
- **Admin: connection active/inactive toggle** — Each connection has an NcCheckboxRadioSwitch toggle to temporarily disable it without deleting. Inactive connections show a specific message in widgets ("This connection is currently disabled by an administrator.") and are excluded from the widget editor dropdown. Re-enabling restores all widgets automatically — no reconfiguration needed. Toggle saves immediately
- **Admin: connection status badges** — Connection cards show configuration status as text badges: "Configured" (green), "Not configured" (orange), "Token missing" (orange), "Credentials missing" (orange). Replaces the previous green/grey dots for better visibility
- **Admin: connection remove confirmation** — Removing a feed connection shows a Nextcloud-style confirmation dialog instead of a browser prompt
- **Admin: Clean Start DELETE confirmation** — Destructive "Clean Start" action now requires typing `DELETE` to confirm
- **Admin: orphaned data banner** — Automatically detects orphaned data on admin panel load and shows a warning banner with link to Maintenance tab
- **Admin: advanced options collapse** — Endpoint path, response mapping, and custom headers for custom REST API connections are behind an "Advanced options" toggle
- **Admin: column width warning** — Shows a warning when the configured number of page columns may be too narrow for the available width, with a recommendation for fewer columns
- **Feed widget: error messages** — Specific error messages for inactive connections, 404 (connection not found), 401 (authentication required), 403 (access denied), and 429 (rate limited) instead of generic "Could not load feed"

### Changed
- **Feed widget: HTTP timeout reduced** — Outbound HTTP timeout reduced from 10s to 5s to prevent PHP worker blocking when external sources are slow (`FeedReaderService.php`)
- **Bundle splitting** — Enabled webpack `splitChunks` to separate vendor code (~2.9 MB) from application code (~220 KB). Main bundle reduced from 3.7 MB to 220 KB. Vendor chunk is shared between main and admin entry points and cached separately by browsers (`webpack.config.js`)
- **TipTap lazy-loaded** — TipTap editor and all 8 extensions (~240 KB) are loaded dynamically via `import()` on first editor mount. Pages viewed in read-only mode never download the editor code (`InlineTextEditor.vue`)
- **Widget components lazy-loaded** — All widget components (News, People, Calendar, Feed, Links, InlineTextEditor) loaded via `defineAsyncComponent`. Pages only download the widget types they actually use (`Widget.vue`)
- **Widget watchers debounced** — Deep watchers on News, People, and Feed widgets debounced with 300ms delay to prevent API call bursts during editor configuration changes (`NewsWidget.vue`, `PeopleWidget.vue`, `FeedWidget.vue`)
- **Widget initial fetch deferred** — News and Feed widgets use `requestIdleCallback` for initial data fetch, improving perceived page load performance
- **Page + lock fetch parallelized** — Page content and lock status are now fetched in parallel via `Promise.all` instead of sequentially, eliminating ~100ms waterfall (`App.vue`)
- **Engagement settings cached** — Engagement settings now use `CacheService` with 5-minute TTL, consistent with navigation and footer caching (`App.vue`)
- **News widget: collection limit** — Recursive folder scan stops after collecting enough items (default: `max(limit * 4, 200)`) instead of scanning all folders before applying `array_slice` (`PageService.php`)
- **Tree components: progressive rendering** — PageTreeItem and PageTreeSelectItem render max 50 children per node initially with a "Show more" button for additional items. Prevents DOM bloat with large page hierarchies (`PageTreeItem.vue`, `PageTreeSelectItem.vue`)
- **Navigation/footer HTTP caching** — Added `Cache-Control: private, max-age=300, must-revalidate` and `ETag` headers to navigation and footer API responses, consistent with the existing feed API pattern (`NavigationController.php`, `FooterController.php`)
- **Feed widget: unified connection architecture** — Replaced separate source types (Moodle, Canvas, Brightspace, REST API custom) with a single "Connection" concept. Editors choose RSS or Connection; the admin configures connections with presets (Jira, Confluence, SharePoint, OpenProject, AFAS, TOPdesk, Custom, plus LMS types). Presets auto-fill endpoint, auth method, and response mapping. LMS-specific logic (Moodle POST body auth, Canvas context_codes, Brightspace org unit) is preserved internally but hidden from the user. Backwards-compatible with existing connections
- **Calendar widget: IManager refactor** — Replaced `CalDavBackend` with `OCP\Calendar\IManager` for fetching calendars. This properly handles both regular calendars and ICS subscriptions. Calendar identifiers changed from numeric IDs to string keys (`CalendarService.php`, `CalendarController.php`, `PageService.php`)
- **Calendar widget: hide ICS subscriptions from selector** — Nextcloud ICS subscriptions are no longer shown in the calendar selector since external feeds are now managed via the dedicated ICS URL field
- **CSS theming compliance** — Replaced non-standard `--color-text-light` with `--color-text-maxcontrast` in Feed and News widgets. Replaced hardcoded `#fff`/`white` with `var(--color-primary-element-text)`. Replaced hardcoded `border-radius` values with NC variables. Standardized font-weight to 600 (NC convention). Dark theme backgrounds now use `var(--color-primary-element-light)` instead of hardcoded rgba values. Affects: `FeedItem.vue`, `NewsItem.vue`, `CalendarWidget.vue`, `FeedWidgetEditor.vue`

### Fixed
- **Calendar widget wrong events shown** — When an ICS subscription had the same numeric ID as a regular calendar, the widget showed events from the wrong calendar. Fixed by switching to unique string keys via IManager
- **REST API SSRF hardening** — Connection base URL is now re-validated on every fetch request, not just at save time. Prevents SSRF if an admin account is compromised and a malicious URL is injected into stored connection config
- **Version restore not persisting** — Restoring a page version appeared to work but reverted after a hard refresh. Root cause: the backend reused a stale file node after `IVersionManager::rollback()`, and the frontend masked the issue by showing a version preview instead of the actual restored page. Fixed by re-obtaining a fresh file node after rollback and clearing the version preview after restore
- **SSRF hardening: LMS connectors** — Added `validateUrl()` with private IP range blocking to Moodle, Canvas, and Brightspace fetch methods. Previously only the generic REST API connector validated URLs at fetch time
- **SSRF hardening: ICS calendar feeds** — Added private/reserved IP range blocking to `ExternalIcsService::validateUrl()`. Previously only enforced HTTPS without checking for internal network addresses
- **SSRF hardening: SharePoint & Jira** — Added `validateUrl()` to `resolveSharePointSiteId()` and `getJiraProjects()` to block requests to private IP ranges
- **SSRF hardening: Confluence API importer** — Added URL validation with private IP range blocking to the Confluence REST API importer's base URL
- **XXE hardening: Confluence importer** — Added `LIBXML_NONET` flag to `DOMDocument::loadXML()` and `loadHTML()` in the Confluence Storage Format parser to prevent external entity resolution
- **Token handling: Jira project listing** — Replaced direct admin token decryption with `resolveToken()` for consistent token resolution across all connector methods

### Security
- **CSP hardened** — Removed `unsafe-eval` from Content Security Policy. The Vue 3 runtime-only build and TipTap editor do not require `eval()`. This was a historical precaution that is no longer needed (`PageController.php`)
- **HMAC key hardened** — Image proxy signature key now uses `hash('sha256', ...)` for proper 256-bit key derivation instead of string concatenation (`FeedReaderService.php`)
- **API response size limit** — External API responses larger than 10 MB are rejected before JSON parsing to prevent out-of-memory conditions (`FeedReaderService.php`)

### Accessibility
- **Feed widget aria-live** — Loading and content states announced to screen readers via `aria-live="polite"` and `role="status"` (`FeedWidget.vue`)
- **Feed item semantics** — Removed conflicting `role="article"` from feed item `<a>` tags. Added `focus-visible` outline for keyboard navigation (`FeedItem.vue`)
- **Admin loading spinners** — All loading spinners in admin settings now have `role="status"` and `aria-label="Loading"` for screen reader users (`AdminSettings.vue`)
- **Connection card keyboard nav** — Feed connection expand/collapse headers are keyboard-accessible with `tabindex`, `role="button"`, `aria-expanded`, and Enter/Space handlers (`AdminSettings.vue`)
- **Status dot contrast** — Disconnected connection status indicator has a visible border for better contrast on light backgrounds (`AdminSettings.vue`)

### Documentation

- Updated [ACCESSIBILITY.md](docs/user/accessibility.md) with feed widget and admin panel accessibility improvements

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-16 — Accessibility & bug fixes

### Fixed
- **People widget filter persistence** — Filters using the "does not contain" operator were silently converted to "equals" on save because `not_contains` was missing from the backend operator whitelist. After a page refresh the filter showed different results. The operator is now correctly preserved
- **People widget filter value encoding** — Filter values containing special characters (`&`, `<`, `>`, quotes) were HTML-encoded on save via `htmlspecialchars()`, causing them to no longer match user profile data (e.g., "R&D" became "R&amp;D"). Filter values now use a dedicated `sanitizeFilterValue()` that strips tags and control characters without HTML-encoding. Existing corrupted values are automatically decoded on read
- **Editor contrast on colored rows** — Column labels, placeholder text ("Enter text..."), column borders, and "Add Widget" buttons now adapt to dark row backgrounds (Primary color). Previously these elements were nearly invisible on dark backgrounds

### Added
- **Skip-to-content link** — Keyboard users can skip past the navigation to reach the main content directly (App.vue, PublicPageView.vue)
- **Semantic landmarks** — `<header>`, `<main>` elements replace generic `<div>` wrappers for better screen reader navigation
- **ARIA tab patterns** — Proper `role="tablist/tab/tabpanel"` with `aria-selected` on NewPageModal and MediaPicker tab interfaces
- **ARIA combobox pattern** — PageTreeSelect now announces as a combobox with `aria-expanded` and `role="listbox"` on the dropdown
- **Carousel accessibility** — News carousel has `role="region"`, `aria-roledescription`, `aria-label`, `aria-live="polite"` for slide announcements, and respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Live regions** — Loading states use `role="status"` with `aria-live="polite"`, error states use `role="alert"` (App.vue, PublicPageView.vue, CalendarWidget.vue)
- **Focus-visible styles** — Global `*:focus-visible` outline for keyboard navigation visibility
- **Reduced motion support** — Global `prefers-reduced-motion` media query disables all CSS animations and transitions. Carousel autoplay is skipped when the user prefers reduced motion
- **Visually-hidden utility class** — `.visually-hidden` CSS class for screen reader-only content
- **Breadcrumb current page** — `aria-current="page"` marks the active page in breadcrumb navigation
- **Accessibility documentation** — New [ACCESSIBILITY.md](docs/user/accessibility.md) documenting WCAG 2.1 AA compliance status, legal framework (Wet Digitale Overheid), and implemented measures

### Changed
- **Form labels associated with inputs** — All form inputs across 15+ components now have programmatically associated labels via `for`/`id` pairs or `aria-label` attributes (WidgetEditor, NewPageModal, PageTreeSelect, CommentSection, MediaPicker, AdminSettings, PageEditor, NewsWidgetEditor, PeopleWidgetEditor, CalendarWidgetEditor, LinksEditor, NavigationEditor, PublicPageView)
- **Icon buttons accessible** — All icon-only buttons in InlineTextEditor toolbar, carousel navigation, MediaPicker, and AdminSettings now have `aria-label` attributes
- **Draft badge contrast improved** — Fallback text color darkened from `#856404` to `#6d5003` for a 5.5:1 contrast ratio (WCAG AA requires 4.5:1)
- **Dropdown accessibility** — Navigation dropdowns have `aria-haspopup` and `aria-expanded` attributes
- **WelcomeScreen heading** — Changed from `<h1>` to `<h2>` to prevent duplicate h1 on the page
- **Password error announced** — Public page password error message has `role="alert"` for screen reader announcement
- **MediaPicker strings translated** — All hardcoded English strings wrapped in `t()` translation function

### Fixed
- **Focus anti-pattern removed** — Removed `event.target.blur()` in Navigation.vue that was stripping keyboard focus after clicking the page structure button

### Documentation
- Added [ACCESSIBILITY.md](docs/user/accessibility.md) with full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance matrix
- Added accessibility link to README documentation section

## [1.1.2] - 2026-04-10 — App Store listing improvements

### Fixed
- **Telemetry error feedback**: The "Send report now" button now shows the actual server error message (e.g., rate limit, connectivity issue) instead of silently failing
- **MetaVox icon dynamic loaded** — MetaVox sidebar tab icon is no longer a hardcoded SVG copy. Now loads dynamically from the MetaVox app via `imagePath('metavox', 'app.svg')`, so logo changes in MetaVox are automatically reflected in IntraVox. Dark mode handled by Nextcloud's automatic `app-dark.svg` serving

### Changed
- **App Store description rewritten** — Expanded from ~150 to ~250 words, structured in 6 sections: page editor, widgets, collaboration, content management, enterprise, and requirements
- **App Store summary** — Changed to "SharePoint-style intranet pages for Nextcloud — no code required"
- **Author updated to VoxCloud** — Author name, email (info@voxcloud.nl), and homepage (voxcloud.nl) now reflect VoxCloud branding
- **Screenshots expanded from 3 to 7** — Added calendar widget, people widget, news carousel, templates, and engagement screenshots
- **Category `social` added** — Reflects engagement features (reactions, comments, people widget)

### Added
- **Documentation links in App Store** — Editor Guide, Admin Guide, and API Development Guide now linked from the app listing

### Security
- **axios upgraded to 1.15.0+** — Fixes critical SSRF vulnerability via NO_PROXY hostname normalization bypass ([GHSA-3p68-rc4w-qgx5](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3p68-rc4w-qgx5))

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-08 — Support settings & demo data fix

### Added
- **Support contact settings** — New admin settings section for configuring organization name and support contact details. Contact information is included in telemetry for easier support identification
- **App Store screenshots** — Added calendar widget screenshots (layout, editor, primary, sidebar) and updated admin demo data and edit mode screenshots

### Changed
- **Contact info updated** — Author email changed to info@voxcloud.nl and website URL to voxcloud.nl
- **Admin settings refactored** — Extracted support/contact settings into dedicated `SupportSettings` component for cleaner code organization

### Security
- **serialize-javascript upgraded to 7.0.5** — Fixes excessive CPU usage vulnerability in array-like object serialization during webpack build process ([#42](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/42))
- **brace-expansion upgraded to 5.0.5** — Fixes bracket handling vulnerability ([#40](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/40))

### Fixed
- **Demo data imports all languages** — Demo data setup now detects the single active language and imports only that language's content, instead of importing all available languages regardless of configuration

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-29 — Calendar widget & security fixes

### Added
- **Calendar widget** — New widget that displays upcoming events from shared Nextcloud calendars. Supports multi-calendar selection (merged view), configurable date range, event limit, and show/hide time and location. Events are shown with colored date badges matching the calendar color. Recurring events (RRULE) are correctly expanded into individual occurrences
- **Responsive calendar layout** — Calendar widget automatically adapts to available space: 1 column in side columns, 2 columns in medium containers, 3 columns in wide content areas (via CSS container queries)

### Fixed
- **People widget users lost on reload** — User IDs containing dots, `@` signs, or spaces (common in LDAP/SAML/OIDC environments) were silently stripped during save, causing selected users to disappear after page reload ([#41](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/41))
- **Deploy script OPcache** — Added Apache/PHP-FPM restart to deploy script to clear OPcache after deploying new PHP controllers

### Security
- **Rate limiting on public People API** — Added `AnonRateThrottle` to the public share endpoint for the People widget to prevent user enumeration

### Documentation
- **Language & demo data** — Added guidance that Nextcloud language setting must match the imported demo data language. Added troubleshooting entry for "Admin sees empty Welcome page after demo import" ([#37](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/37))

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-09 — Editor group & scenarios

### Added
- **IntraVox Editors group** — A third permission group (`IntraVox Editors`) is now automatically created during setup with Read + Write + Create permissions. This provides a three-tier permission model out of the box: Users (read), Editors (read/write/create), Admins (full access)
- **Scenarios documentation** — New [SCENARIOS.md](docs/admin/scenarios.md) guide with step-by-step recipes for content approval workflows (using the Nextcloud Approval app and MetaVox) and department-based intranets

### Documentation
- Updated ADMIN_GUIDE, AUTHORIZATION, EDITOR_GUIDE, and README to reflect the new three-group permission model

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-08 — First stable release

IntraVox 1.0 marks the first stable release. After 19 iterative releases, the app offers a complete intranet platform: a full page builder with 10+ widget types, page versioning, templates, public sharing, RSS feeds, engagement (reactions & comments), draft/published workflow, concurrent edit protection, and multi-language support. The JSON page format and REST API are considered stable from this version onward.

### Added
- **Page locking** — Pessimistic locking prevents concurrent edits. When a user starts editing a page, other users see who is editing and the Edit button is disabled. Locks auto-expire after 15 minutes of inactivity, with a 60-second heartbeat to keep active sessions alive. Locks are released on save, cancel, navigation, and tab close
- **Lock safety net in API** — Backend `updatePage()` rejects saves with HTTP 409 if the page is locked by another user, preventing data loss even if the frontend check is bypassed
- **Force unlock for admins** — IntraVox Admins can force-release a page lock held by another user (e.g. after a browser crash). Includes confirmation dialog to warn about potential unsaved changes
- **Draft pages** ([#32](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/32)) — Pages can be saved as "Draft" or "Published". Draft pages are only visible to users with write permission and are hidden from read-only users, public shares, search results, RSS feeds, and the page tree. Editors see a clickable status badge in edit mode to toggle between Draft and Published, and a "Draft" indicator in view mode. Backward compatible: existing pages without a status field default to Published
- **Duplicate row** ([#32](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/32)) — Editors can duplicate a complete row (including all columns and widgets) with a single click. The duplicate button appears in the row controls next to the delete button
- **Sticky edit toolbar** ([#32](https://github.com/nextcloud/IntraVox/issues/32)) — The header toolbar with Save/Cancel buttons stays fixed at the top of the viewport when scrolling, making it accessible on long pages

### Changed
- **Page lock translations** — Lock-related UI strings translated to English, Dutch, German, and French
- **Draft/duplicate translations** — Draft, Published, and Duplicate row strings translated to English, Dutch, German, and French
- **New pages default to Draft** — Newly created pages (both blank and from template) start as Draft and automatically open in edit mode so editors can begin working immediately

### Fixed
- **Links widget tile overflow** — Tiles in narrow containers (sidebar, small columns) no longer shrink to unreadable vertical text. Tiles auto-wrap to the next row when there isn't enough horizontal space, while respecting the configured column count when space allows

### Documentation
- **Editor guide** — Added sections for sticky toolbar, page locking, draft/published status with visibility table, duplicate rows, and updated creating new pages workflow
- **Admin guide** — Added page locking and draft pages sections, updated security considerations
- **README** — Added page editor features (duplicate rows, sticky toolbar, page locking, draft/published), new feature sections with screenshots, updated security section

## [0.9.18] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Spacer widget rendering** - Spacer widget now renders correctly in view mode with configurable height (10-200px). Previously fell through to "Unknown Widget Type" error display
- **Links widget tiles layout** - Links widget now supports a `tiles` layout alongside the existing `list` layout. Tiles display a larger icon (36px) with a separate title and subtitle on two lines, creating a card-style presentation. Editors can switch between layouts and set title/subtitle per link in tile mode
- **30+ extra link icons** - Added icons for common intranet use cases: folders, chat, dashboard, contacts, forms, code, support, security, organization, news, and more
- **5 unique demo showcases** with rich, diverse layouts demonstrating all widget types:
  - **de-linden** (Universiteit) — 4 photos, 1/2/3/4-column rows, video, people grid, SURF services, right sidebar
  - **van-der-berg** (Advocatenkantoor) — 3 photos, header row, news grid, file widgets, no sidebars
  - **gemeente-duin** (Gemeente) — 3 photos, 1/2/3/5-column rows, left sidebar, news list
  - **de-bron** (Zorggroep) — 3 photos, 4-column department overview, people cards, video, file widgets, right sidebar
  - **horizon-labs** (Tech startup) — 2 photos, news carousel, culture row, right sidebar

### Documentation
- **Showcases guide** (`SHOWCASES.md`) — Complete documentation of all 5 showcases: widget coverage matrix, technical structure, background color guidelines, image handling, and people widget portability
- **Editor guide updated** — Added documentation for file, spacer, news, and people widgets; updated column support from 1-3 to 1-5; documented collapsible rows, header rows, and side columns
- **Export/import updated** — Widget types list expanded from 6 to 10 (added links, file, news, people)

## [0.9.17] - 2026-03-01

### Added
