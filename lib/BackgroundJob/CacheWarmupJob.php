/**
 * Pre-warms IntraVox caches so the first user of the day doesn't pay the
 * cold-cache cost on the homepage/navigation render.
 *
 * The distributed caches we maintain (intravox-pages tree + content,
 * intravox-permissions path-map) are wiped on every page mutation, so
 * post-deploy or post-mutation periods have a few hundred ms of cold
 * latency until the first reader rebuilds them. For enterprise instances
 * with thousands of users hitting `/apps/intravox/` simultaneously after
 * a deploy, that "first reader" becomes a thundering herd.
 *
 * This job runs every 15 minutes and forces a rebuild for each supported
 * language by walking the same code paths as a real request:
 * - PermissionService::buildPagePathMap → caches per-language path map
 * - PageTreeService::getPageTree → caches per-group tree
 *
 * Both of those store their result via distributed cache, so subsequent
 * real users see warm hits regardless of which front-end node serves
 * their request.
 *
 * Marked TIME_INSENSITIVE so it doesn't compete with user-facing cron
 * windows.
