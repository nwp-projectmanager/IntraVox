/**
 * One way to ask "may this user write to this page?" (controller split, PR-B).
 *
 * Eight endpoints in ApiController each carried their own copy:
 *
 *     $page = $this->getPageReadService()->getPage($id);
 *     if (!($page['permissions']['canWrite'] ?? false)) { ... 403 ... }
 *
 * Identical apart from the message. Eight copies of a security check is eight
 * chances to forget the ninth, and the `?? false` is the part that matters:
 * a page whose permissions could not be determined must read as "no", never as
 * "unset, so allow".
 *
 * Returns the page on success and a DataResponse on refusal, so a caller cannot
 * accidentally continue past a denial — it has to handle the Response to get at
 * the page. That is the whole point of returning a union rather than a bool.
 *
 * Usage:
 *     $page = $this->requireWritablePage($id, 'cannot edit this page');
 *     if ($page instanceof DataResponse) {
 *         return $page;
 *     }

    /**
     * The read-permission companion. Unlike requireWritablePage it does NOT
     * fetch the page: the read endpoints already call getPage() once (they need
     * the page anyway) and check permissions on that array, so re-fetching here
     * would double the call and could diverge if the two reads disagreed. It
     * therefore takes the already-loaded page and returns the refusal, or null
     * when access is allowed.
     *
     * The default denial body is the bare 'Access denied' every read gate uses
     * today; a caller with a different message (e.g. the source-page check in
     * ApiController) passes its own so consolidating changes no response body.
     *
     * Usage:
     *     $page = $this->getPageReadService()->getPage($id);

     *         return $denied;
