/**
 * The TRANSLATE-query/link domain carved out of the PageService god-class: the
 * four operations that read or wire the relationship between the language
 * versions of a page.
 *
 *   - linkTranslation / unlinkTranslation: wire two pages into one shared
 *     translation group, or detach a page into a fresh solo group.
 *   - getTranslatableLanguages: the languages a page can still be created in.
 *   - getTranslationCandidates: the existing pages a page could be linked to.
 *
 * The mechanics live in the TranslationGroupService engine (ctor-injected).
 * Page lookup (via PageLocator), the language-of-folder derivation (FolderContext)
 * and the display-name lookup (LanguageService) are all real injected
 * collaborators, so the CTOR is closure-free and the service is directly
 * injectable (container-buildable). The two shared WRITE concerns — the
 * group-writer (also used by the compose-domain createTranslation, so it belongs
 * to the hub) and the cache-clear (the cross-collaborator invalidation still
 * resident on PageService) — are passed as per-call closures on the two write
 * methods (link/unlink) rather than on the ctor, so only the write callers supply
 * them and DI never has to autowire a \Closure.
