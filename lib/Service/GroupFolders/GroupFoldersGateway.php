/**
 * The one place IntraVox talks to the groupfolders app. (GFG-0, SE-1)
 *
 * Two things were spread across the codebase and are consolidated here.
 *
 * First, the service-locator lookup. Eight sites did
 * `\OC::$server->get(FolderManager::class)` by hand, which is untyped, untestable
 * and silently fatal when the groupfolders app is disabled. FolderManager cannot
 * simply be constructor-injected: groupfolders is an optional app, so the class
 * may not exist at all, and injecting it would make IntraVox fail to boot
 * without it. So the lookup stays lazy — but it happens once, here.
 *
 * Second, the resolution loop. Four call sites walked getAllFolders() looking for
 * a mount point and keeping the highest id, in code that was identical apart from
 * error handling, and two of them carried their own copy of the mount-point
 * extraction. getAllFolders() is three unbounded queries plus an object per row,
 * and getSharedFolder() has 41 call sites, several on the page-render path — so
 * on an instance with thousands of team folders this dominated page load.
 *
 * Resolution is memoised per request. The id is safe to cache; the Folder NODE it
 * resolves to deliberately is not, because that object is user-view dependent and
 * this runs both in request scope and from occ.
