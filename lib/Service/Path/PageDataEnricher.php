 * Enriches a decoded page array with the real-time, filesystem-derived fields:
 * path/depth/parentPath/parentId/language/department, and — when the page file
 * node is available — the per-user permissions/canEdit, the concurrency
 * baseVersion, fileId, the ACL-filtered translations list, and MetaVox
 * availability + groupfolderId.
 *
 * Extracted verbatim from PageService::enrichWithPathData(). This is NOT the #70
 * distributed-cache-hit recompute (that stays inline in getPage as the security
 * boundary) — this is the fresh-build enrichment shared by getPage,
 * findPageByFolderPath and getPageMetadata.
 *
 * The folder-root-relative path comes from the injected FolderContext (the
 * substrate). Translations and the groupfolder id are resolved IN this service now
 * (phase-2 steps 1+3), over its own injected TranslationGroupService (the private
 * resolveTranslations() below) and GroupfolderResolver — no closures, and the same
 * collaborators the #70 block uses. PageMetadataTest and the getPage suites pin the
 * derived fields.
