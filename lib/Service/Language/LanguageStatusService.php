/**
 * The "where does content live, per language?" reader — the language-CONTENT-
 * STATUS domain carved out of the PageService god-class.
 *
 * Two questions, one responsibility:
 *   - getContentStatus(): which languages have real vs placeholder homepages,
 *     which language the user is actually served (#75 fallback), and the
 *     homepage the app should land on. Drives the landing-page fallback notice
 *     and the admin "Languages with content" chips.
 *   - getPageCountByLanguage(): how many pages each language folder holds — the
 *     number the admin "remove language" confirmation warns with.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT in scope: the homepage-resolution subsystem and the
 * real-content probe. Those stay resident on PageService — the probe because
 * the FolderContext substrate is built from it (a circular seam), homepage
 * resolution because it is shared with the homepage seam and the API
 * controller. This service receives both only as bound closures, so the shared
 * subsystems cannot leak in here. LanguageStatusIsolationTest enforces that no
 * such symbol is even referenced from this namespace, which is why this
 * docblock names none of them literally.
