 * normalising. Pulling the connectors apart without pulling this out first would
 * mean injecting the same eight helpers into six classes.

     * not enough, though — rawurlencode() leaves "." and ".." untouched, and a
     * whole segment of dots is read by the browser as "go up one level", which
     * moves the link somewhere else on the same host without ever adding a
     * character the encoder would catch. Those are refused outright.

     * would fill the slot with nothing and quietly hand back the half-built URL
     * this method exists to avoid.
