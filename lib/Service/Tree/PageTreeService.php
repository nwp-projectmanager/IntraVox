/**
 * Builds and serves the per-language page tree — extracted verbatim from
 * PageService::getPageTree + shapeTreeResponse + refreshTreePermissions
 * (facade elimination fase-4 capstone).
 *
 * The full per-language tree is cached WHOLE, keyed by groupHash + language, so
 * users that share a group set share one bucket (issue #45). The cached tree
 * carries group-level permissions; because GroupFolder ACLs can grant or deny
 * per USER within the same group, every served response recomputes each node's
 * permissions from the live filesystem view (issue #86 tree-COW). That recompute
 * runs AFTER the cache read/build and BEFORE return, on ALL THREE cache paths
 * (in-process hit, distributed hit, fresh build), and markCurrentPageInTree
 * deep-copies the shared tree before any overwrite so the cache is never polluted.
 * This service OWNS its own PermissionService — the same structural guarantee that
 * lets PageReadService own the #70 per-read recompute — so per-user ACL isolation
 * survives the carve.
