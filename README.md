![Collapsible Sections](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/intravox/main/screenshots/Collapsible-sections.png)

*Collapsible rows for organized content sections*

### Draft & Published Pages

![Draft and Published](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/intravox/main/screenshots/page-draft-published.png)

*Toggle between Draft and Published in edit mode*

Control page visibility with a simple status toggle:

- **New pages start as Draft** — build your content before making it visible
- **Draft pages** are only visible to editors (users with write permission)
- **Published pages** are visible to all users with read access
- Draft pages are hidden from search, RSS feeds, page tree, and public share links
- Click the Draft/Published button in the edit toolbar to toggle

### Page Locking

Prevents conflicting edits when multiple editors work on the same site:

- **Automatic locking** — entering edit mode locks the page for other users
- **Lock indicator** — other editors see who is editing and since when
- **Auto-expiry** — locks expire after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Admin override** — IntraVox Admins can force-unlock a page

### Duplicate Rows

![Duplicate Row](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/intravox/main/screenshots/row-copy.png)

*Click the copy icon to duplicate a row with all its widgets*

Speed up page building by duplicating rows: click the copy icon in the row controls to create an exact copy of a row including all columns and widgets. Edit the copy independently.

### Dummy Text Generator (Easter Egg)

![Dad Jokes Generator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/intravox/main/screenshots/dadjokes.gif)

*Type `=dad()` and press Enter to generate placeholder text with dad jokes*

Need placeholder text? Type a command in the text widget and press Enter:

| Command | Result |
|---------|--------|
| `=dad(3,5)` | 3 paragraphs of 5 dad jokes |
| `=lorem(2,4)` | 2 paragraphs of 4 Lorem Ipsum sentences |

Inspired by Microsoft Word's `=rand()` command. Built-in jokes, no internet required.

### Table Support

Full table editing in text widgets:
- Insert tables via the toolbar
- Add/remove rows and columns
- Resize columns by dragging
- Tables saved as Markdown for portability

### Navigation

- **Mobile Menu** - Collapsible hamburger menu on mobile devices

![Megamenu Navigation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/intravox/main/screenshots/megamenu.png)

*Megamenu navigation with all sections visible*

![Page Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/intravox/main/screenshots/PageStructure-edit.png)

*Manage structure: reorder, move, copy, delete and set-as-homepage — the current homepage is protected*

### Engagement

- **Page Reactions** - Users can react to pages with emoji (👍❤️🎉😊🤔👀🚀💯 etc.)
- **Comments** - Full commenting system with threaded replies (1 level deep)
- **Comment Reactions** - React to individual comments with emoji
- **Admin Control** - Enable/disable reactions and comments globally
- **Page-Level Settings** - Override engagement settings per page

### Content Organization

- **Multi-Language Support** - Separate content per language (Dutch, English, German, French)
- **Nested Pages** - Create pages inside other pages for hierarchical organization
- **Footer** - Editable footer section on the homepage
- **Breadcrumb Navigation** - Automatic breadcrumb trail for easy navigation

### Multilingual Content (2.0)

- **Linked translations** - Pages link to their versions in other languages; the model is symmetric, so there is no "original" and removing one language never breaks the rest
- **Reader language switcher** - Opening a page in another language shows a notice with a one-click switch to the reader's own language; shared links always open the page they point to
- **Create in another language** - One click copies a page (content *and* images) as a draft into the same position in the target language's tree
- **Deep pages just work** - Translating a page three levels deep does not require translating its parents first; missing levels render as non-clickable labels in the tree until they are translated too
- **Invisible when unused** - Single-language intranets see none of this: no tab, no menu entry, no notices
- **Fast at scale** - A page index answers lookups in one query where a 3,000-page intranet used to need thousands of file reads; `occ intravox:reindex` rebuilds it after a restore

### Security & Permissions

- **Nextcloud Native Permissions** - Uses GroupFolder ACL for access control
- **Folder-Level Permissions** - Set different permissions per folder/page
- **Permission-Based Filtering** - Navigation only shows pages the user can access
- **Draft Page Visibility** - Draft pages are only visible to users with write permission
- **Page Locking** - Prevents concurrent edits with automatic expiry and admin override
- **Real-Time Permission Checks** - Changes take effect immediately
- **Profile Field Visibility** - People widgets honour the visibility each user set per field; private fields are never shown
- **No Staff Directory on Public Links** - People widgets are withheld from public share links by default, so sharing documents never publishes a list of colleagues

### Admin Settings

- **Engagement Settings** - Enable/disable page reactions, comments, and comment reactions
- **Publication Settings** - Configure MetaVox date fields for content scheduling
- **Video Embed Domains** - Configure which video platforms are allowed
- **Privacy-First Defaults** - YouTube privacy mode and PeerTube enabled by default

### Integration

- **Nextcloud Unified Search** - Search pages via Ctrl+K with IntraVox app icon
- **Nextcloud Comments API** - Reactions and comments use native Nextcloud infrastructure
- **MetaVox Integration** - Pages get a MetaVox tab in their sidebar with the Team Folder's metadata fields — same fields and behaviour as the Files app, rendered from MetaVox's own API so it survives Nextcloud upgrades. Metadata also filters News, Photo Story and File Story widgets (when MetaVox is installed)
- **Photo Story Widget** - Rich photo-album presentation with date + location headers, three visual styles (Magazine / Apple / Travelogue), interactive lightbox, and cross-folder filtering via MetaVox metadata
- **Files App Integration** - Pages stored as JSON files in GroupFolder
- **OpenAPI Documentation** - Complete API specification for third-party integration
- **OCS API Viewer** - Interactive API documentation when OCS API Viewer app is installed
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

### Performance

- **Smart Caching** - Intelligent cache refresh reduces unnecessary API calls by 50%
- **localStorage Persistence** - Cache survives browser refresh for instant page loads
- **Lazy Loading** - Sidebar tabs and data load on-demand

### Security

- **Nextcloud Authentication** - All pages require Nextcloud login
- **GroupFolder Permissions** - Native ACL-based access control
- **Path Traversal Protection** - Enhanced path sanitization
- **ZIP Slip Prevention** - Secure ZIP extraction with path validation
- **SVG Sanitization** - Uploaded SVG files are sanitized to prevent XSS
- **Secure Temp Files** - Cryptographically secure filenames with restrictive permissions

## System Requirements

| Component | Minimum | Recommended |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Nextcloud | 32-33 | 33+ |
| PHP | 8.2+ | 8.3+ |
| PHP memory_limit | 256MB | 512MB |
| GroupFolders app | Required | Required |

> ⚠️ **Important**: The default PHP memory_limit of 128MB is insufficient for IntraVox. Demo data installation requires at least 256MB. Update your `php.ini` if needed.

### Optional companion apps

| App | Purpose | Required for |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| **MetaVox** | Custom metadata fields on GroupFolders | Photo Story cross-folder filtering, News widget MetaVox filters, people/subjects/custom-location overlays. **Optional** — Photo Story works with just NC core FilesMetadata. |
| **Recognize** | On-device face + object recognition | Photo Story people/subjects metadata via MetaVox (only used if MetaVox is also installed) |
| **camerarawpreviews** | Thumbnails for RAW formats (CR2 / NEF / ARW / DNG / etc.) | Photo Story thumbnails for RAW files. Without it RAW tiles fall back to a styled placeholder. Install via `occ app:install camerarawpreviews`. |
| **previewgenerator** | Pre-generates thumbnails in the background | Fast Photo Story loading on large folders. Strongly recommended for folders > 200 photos. Install via `occ app:install previewgenerator`. |

### Performance recommendations

For Photo Story widgets pointing at folders with **hundreds or thousands of photos**:

1. **Pre-generate thumbnails** with the `previewgenerator` app:
   ```bash
   # One-time, run after a big import (can take hours on 100k+ photos):
   occ preview:generate-all

   # Then schedule via system cron (or systemd timer) for incremental updates:
   */15 * * * * www-data php /var/www/html/occ preview:pre-generate
   ```
   Without this, RAW thumbnails are generated on first view (~1s per file). With it: cached, ~10ms.

2. **Enable a Redis cache** in Nextcloud's `config.php`:
   ```php
   'memcache.distributed' => '\OC\Memcache\Redis',
   'memcache.locking' => '\OC\Memcache\Redis',
   ```
   Photo Story uses `OCP\ICacheFactory` to memoize per-folder timeline + highlights computations. Repeat page-loads drop from ~500ms to ~10ms.

3. **EXIF data sources (Photo Story)** — Photo Story reads photo EXIF from two sources, in this order:

   1. **Nextcloud core FilesMetadata** (NC 28+). NC's own scanner indexes every uploaded photo into `oc_files_metadata` with well-known keys (`photos-original_date_time`, `photos-gps`, `photos-ifd0`, `photos-size`). **This is the primary source** — no app-specific field-name mapping needed.

      Trigger a full scan once after installation or large bulk imports:
      ```bash
      occ files:scan --all
      ```
      Schedule incremental scans via NC's built-in cron. The scanner picks up new uploads automatically.

   2. **MetaVox custom fields** (optional). MetaVox adds people, subjects, custom location-string, custom country labels — things NC core doesn't track. Photo Story uses these *in addition to* NC core data. If you want these enrichments, a server-side Python toolset can write them to MetaVox via the OCS API, designed to run from a cron job.

   You don't need MetaVox for the core experience. NC core alone gives you date, GPS, camera, and image dimensions for every scanned photo.

4. **Tune EXIF behavior** via app config:
   ```bash
   # Default: skip per-file EXIF extraction in the API request (sparse rows, fastest).
   # The lightbox lazily fetches EXIF per opened photo via /photo-story/photo-exif.
   occ config:app:set intravox photostory.exif.eager_in_request --value="no"

   # Emergency fallback for folders without MetaVox backfill: eagerly extract EXIF.
   # Slower; capped at N files per request to avoid timeouts on large folders.
   occ config:app:set intravox photostory.exif.eager_in_request --value="yes"
   occ config:app:set intravox photostory.exif.eager_cap --value="200"
   ```
   Production setups should use the MetaVox backfill (#3 above) instead of eager EXIF.

5. **Tune reverse-geocoding** (place-name resolution):
   ```bash
   # Default: enabled, caps new fetches at 20/request to avoid Nominatim rate-limit bans.
   occ config:app:set intravox photostory.geocode.max_new_per_request --value="20"

   # Use a self-hosted Nominatim if you have one:
   occ config:app:set intravox photostory.geocode.endpoint --value="https://your-nominatim.example/reverse"
   ```

### Photo Story: map provider

IntraVox does **not** bundle a map tile server. By default Photo Story uses OpenStreetMap's public tile server (`https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`), which is fine for personal and small-team use but is rate-limited under [OSM's Tile Usage Policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/) for heavier deployments.

**Options for production**:

- **Stick with OSM** for personal or low-traffic intranets. No configuration needed.

- **Use your own tile server** (PMTiles, MapTiler, Stadia Maps, etc.) by setting:
  ```bash
  occ config:app:set intravox photostory.tiles.url --value="https://tiles.example.com/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
  occ config:app:set intravox photostory.tiles.attribution --value="© Your provider"
  occ config:app:set intravox photostory.tiles.max_zoom --value="19"
  ```

- **Disable map features entirely** (privacy mode — no external network requests):
  ```bash
  occ config:app:set intravox photostory.map.enabled --value="no"
  ```
  This disables all `Show map` / `Show daily mini-map` toggles globally; users get a "Disabled by administrator" hint in the editor.

Self-hosting PMTiles is a recommended option for production. See [Protomaps](https://docs.protomaps.com/) for setup instructions — a NL extract is ~250 MB and can be served as a static file from any HTTP server.

## Troubleshooting

### "Could not find resource intravox/js/intravox-main.js to load"

This error typically occurs after updating IntraVox and is caused by Nextcloud's resource cache not being refreshed. To fix it, run one of the following commands on your server:

```bash
# Option 1: Run maintenance repair (recommended)
sudo -u www-data php occ maintenance:repair

# Option 2: Disable and re-enable the app
sudo -u www-data php occ app:disable intravox
sudo -u www-data php occ app:enable intravox
```

After running either command, refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5) to clear the browser cache.
